# Organize team members for {{Token-LongName}} in Azure

{{Token-Name}} architecture was designed with a set of core principles.

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Organize methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts.

## Core principles

- **Self-service enablement:** Enable project teams to work on their own to allow agile development methods.

- **Governance:** Enforce guardrails across the Azure platform to ensure that project teams only see, change, and execute the functions within their permissions.

- **Streamlined deployments:** Ensure that common policies are available within the organization to help teams scale quickly and support teams with less experience in some core designs and artifacts.
