# Landing zone accelerator for {{Token-LongName}} - {{Insert-accelerator-name}} landing zone accelerator

The {{Token-LongName}} landing zone accelerator is an open-source collection of Terraform templates that you can use to automate the deployment of an environment capable of hosting {{Token-LongName}}. It can provide a specific architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare your enterprise-scale landing zones. The landing zones adhere to the architecture and best practices of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

Customers adopt {{Token-LongName}} in various ways. The landing zone accelerator can be adapted to produce an architecture that fits **your** way and puts your organization on a path to sustainable scale.

## To begin, implement an enterprise-scale landing zone

The {{Token-LongName}} landing zone accelerator assumes that an enterprise-scale landing zone has been successfully implemented. For more information on this prerequisite, review these articles:

- [Start with Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md)
- [Implement Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones in Azure](../../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md)

## What the AKS landing zone accelerator provides

The landing zone accelerator approach to landing zones provides these assets to support your project:

- A modular approach, so that you can customize environment variables
- Design guidelines to aid in evaluating critical decisions
- The landing zone architecture
- An implementation that includes:
  - A deployable reference capable of creating the environment for your {{Token-LongName}} deployment
  - A Microsoft-approved {{Token-LongName}} reference implementation to test the deployed environment
