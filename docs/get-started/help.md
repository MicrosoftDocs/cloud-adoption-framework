# Help finding the appropriate getting started guide

The Cloud Adoption Framework can help you get started in multiple ways, so several getting started guides are provided. This article groups those guides to help you find the one that best aligns with your current challenges.

## What can we help you get started with?

Each link will take you to a group subset of the questions customers typically ask when trying to accomplish these common objectives.

- [Align foundational concepts to onboard a person, project, or team](#align-foundation)
- [Adopting adoption to deliver business and technical outcomes sooner](#accelerate-adoption)
- [Improve controls to ensure proper operations of the cloud](#improve-controls)
- [Establish teams to support adoption and operations](#establish-teams)

## Align foundation

Your company's cloud is built on a set of foundational decisions that can impact all cloud-based outcomes. This getting started guide and conceptual information can help you make core decisions and document them.

- [Azure hierarchy support](../reference/fundamental-concepts/hierarchy-azure-tools.md)
- [Operating model terminology](../operating-model/terms.md)

## Accelerate adoption

Cloud adoption requires technical change, but to digitally transform with the cloud, it requires more than just IT. Use these guides to start aligning various teams to accelerate migration and innovation efforts.
