- [Share your strategy](../strategy/share-your-strategy.md)

### Modern application platform

We expanded and revised the Modern application platform content in this release. Commonly, customers need to provide their developers with a consistent application platform. This article series outlines how you can use orchestrated containers to manage pools of workloads in one or more centralized clusters, thus providing that consistent application platform. The articles in this series for [Modern application platform](../scenarios/aks/index.md) combine technical and non-technical considerations required to prepare for Kubernetes and container integration into centralized operations and your broader cloud strategy.

## April 2021

### Cloud service controls

To help you implement cloud governance at a pace that sustains a high level of innovation, and implements the right level of control for your environment, we've added a new article, [Implement cloud service controls](../govern/cloud-service-controls.md). It focuses on a proven process to help governance teams implement granular controls across the Azure platform, while accelerating the development capabilities for cloud adoption teams. The process can be implemented by enterprises of any size, at any stage of their cloud journey. This guidance outlines the different stages of the process, from taking the enterprise requirements for cloud control for security, operations, and cost management, through the stages of development and release of controls.

### Azure Storage migration overview

To help you plan your Azure Storage migration, we've provided guidance in a new article, [Azure Storage migration overview](/windows-server/storage/storage-migration-service/overview), for two migration scenarios:

- Migration of unstructured data, such as files and objects.
- Migration of block-based devices, such as disks and storage area networks.

## March 2021

This release is the largest update of the framework yet, adding a number of new broad-reaching collections of guidance that span across the entire framework.

### Adoption journeys

Most notable in this release is the addition of adoption journeys, which provide a short, consumable overlay or lenses that rest on top of the deeper framework to accelerate engagement. These shorter guides demonstrate how to apply the guidance in the Cloud Adoption Framework, the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/), the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/), [Microsoft Learn](/learn/), and other [Microsoft documentation](/) to the adoption of specific technology platforms. The following table provides links to the overview page for each of the new journeys:

| Journey | Description |
|--|--|
| [Hybrid&nbsp;and&nbsp;multicloud](../scenarios/hybrid/index.md) | Lifecycle guide to integrate hybrid, multicloud, and unified operations into your cloud adoption journey. |

- [Global reach outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/reach-outcomes.md)
- [Customer engagement outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/engagement-outcomes.md)
- [Performance outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/performance-outcomes.md)
- [Sustainability goals](../strategy/business-outcomes/sustainability.md)

### Enterprise-scale updates

The critical design area of [network topology and connectivity](../ready/azure-best-practices/define-an-azure-network-topology.md) includes new articles that simplify rationalizing individual components of your network design. Those design aspects now include guidance on [connecting to multicloud providers](../ready/azure-best-practices/connectivity-to-other-providers.md) like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We've also released the new enterprise-scale Terraform module to demonstrate Microsoft's continued investment in open-source approaches to Azure landing zone configuration. Lastly, we've updated guidance on how enterprises can [optimize management groups and organize subscriptions](../ready/enterprise-scale/management-group-and-subscription-organization.md) in Azure to meet cloud governance requirements.

### Antipatterns

Companies often miss important steps in their cloud adoption journey. The new [cloud adoption antipatterns](../antipatterns/antipatterns-to-avoid.md) guidance highlights common customer pain points, what skipped step led to that pain, and the fastest path to recovery. The antipatterns are distributed throughout each methodology, but a top 10 list is available in the getting started section of the framework.

### AI + Machine Learning

When planning an Azure Machine Learning deployment for an enterprise environment, there are common decision points that affect how you create the workspaces. We've published a new article, [Organize and set up Azure Machine Learning environments](../ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-resource-organization.md), that highlights these decision areas and the benefits of each:

- **Team structure:** How your Machine Learning teams are organized and collaborate on a project's given use case and data segregation, or cost management requirements.
- **Environments:** The environments used as part of your development and release workflow to segregate development from production.
- **Region:** The location of your data and the audience you need to serve your Machine Learning solution to.

We added a reference implementation example to help illustrate the deployment of Azure Machine Learning in a larger setting. It outlines how the organization 'Contoso' set up Azure Machine Learning given their organizational constraints, reporting, and budgeting requirements.

### Azure Storage migration overview

To help you plan your Azure Storage migration, we've provided guidance in a new article, [Azure Storage migration overview](/windows-server/storage/storage-migration-service/overview), for two migration scenarios:

- Migration of unstructured data, such as files and objects
