# What's new in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Here's a list of recent changes made to the Cloud Adoption Framework.

This framework is built in collaboration with customers, partners, and internal Microsoft teams. New and updated content is released when it becomes available. These releases allow you to test, validate, and refine the guidance along with us. We encourage you to partner with us to build the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

## July 17, 2020

This release adds a number of new scenarios to make cloud adoption more actionable.

### Migration Scenarios

The new [migration scenarios overview page](../scenarios/index.md) builds on the CAF Migrate methodology to demonstrate how Azure delivers on the "#OneMigrate" promise. It provides approaches to migrating multiple first and third party scenarios to Azure. This includes three new migration scenarios:

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Windows Virtual Desktop](../scenarios/wvd/index.md) | This scenario enables productivity boosts and accelerates the migration of various workloads to support the end-user experience. |
| [Azure Stack](../scenarios/azure-stack/index.md) | Learn about deploying Azure in your datacenter using Azure Stack Hub. |

### Analytics in CAF

Analytics solutions are now included in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework. These new topics highlight the best practices for enabling analytics solutions during your cloud adoption journey.

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Analytics solution for Teradata, Netezza, Exadata](../migrate/azure-best-practices/analytics/analytics-solutions-overview.md) | Learn about migrating legacy on-premises environments including Teradata, Netezza, and Exadata to modern Analytics solutions. |
| [High availability for Azure Synapse](../migrate/azure-best-practices/analytics/azure-synapse.md) | Learn about one of the key benefits of a modern cloud-based infrastructure, built-in high availability and disaster recovery. |
| [Schema Migration Data Definition Languages (DDL)](../migrate/azure-best-practices/analytics/schema-migration-ddl.md) | Learn about the database objects and associated processes when preparing to migrate existing data. |

### AI in CAF

Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and best practices are now integrated into the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework. These AI solutions can help accelerate innovation with predictions about customer's needs, automate business processes, discover information, find new ways to engage with customers, and deliver better experiences during your cloud adoption journey.

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Responsible AI](../strategy/responsible-ai.md) | Learn about the AI principles you should consider when implementing AI solutions and learn how to establish a responsible AI strategy. |
| [Azure Innovation Guide: Innovate with AI](../innovate/innovation-guide/predict.md) | Learn about how you can innovate with AI and find the best solution based on your implementation needs. |
| [AI in the Cloud Adoption Framework](../innovate/ai/index.md) | Review a prescriptive framework that includes the tools, programs, and content (best practices, configuration templates, and architecture guidance) to simplify adoption of AI and cloud-native practices at scale. |
| [MLOps with Azure Machine Learning](../manage/mlops-machine-learning.md) | Learn about Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) best practices. |
| [Innovate with AI](../innovate/best-practices/predict.md) | Learn about AI solutions (Machine Learning, AI apps and agents, Knowledge Mining) and best practices that can accelerate digital invention. |

## June 15, 2020

Proper configuration of the cloud environment is often the first and most common technical blocker during cloud adoption. This release focuses heavily on guidance that accelerates deployment of cloud environments. To overcome this common blocker, the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure introduces **Azure landing zones**.

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Azure landing zones](../ready/landing-zone/index.md) | Azure landing zones create a common set of design areas and implementation options to accelerate environment creation aligned to the cloud adoption plan and cloud operating model. This new article defines Azure landing zones more clearly. |
| [Azure landing zones: Design areas](../ready/landing-zone/design-areas.md) | All Azure landing zones share a common set of 8 design areas. Before deploying any of the Azure landing zones, customers should consider each of these design to make critical decisions. |
| [Azure landing zones: Implementation options](../ready/landing-zone/implementation-options.md) | Choose the best Azure landing zone implementation option, depending on your cloud adoption plan and cloud operating model. |

The existing CAF blueprint definitions and CAF Terraform modules provide a starting point for Azure landing zone implementation. However, some customers need a richer implementation option that can meet the demands of enterprise-scale cloud adoption plans. This release adds **CAF enterprise-scale** to the Azure landing zone implementation options to fill that need. The following lists a few of the articles to get you started with the CAF enterprise-scale architecture and reference implementations.

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Enterprise-scale overview](../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md) | Overview to enterprise-scale |
| [Implement enterprise-scale landing zones](../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md) | Rapid implementation options and GitHub examples |
| [Enterprise-scale architecture](../ready/enterprise-scale/architecture.md) | Understand the architecture behind enterprise-scale |
| [Enterprise-scale design principles](../ready/enterprise-scale/design-principles.md) | Understand the architectural design principles that guide decisions during implementation to evaluate if this approach fits your cloud operating model |
| [Enterprise-scale design guideline](../ready/enterprise-scale/design-guidelines.md) | Evaluate the enterprise-scale guidelines for fulfilling the common design areas of Azure landing zones |
| [Implementation guidelines](../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation-guidelines.md) | Review the activities required for an enterprise-scale implementation before deployment |

Partners are an important aspect of successful cloud adoption. Throughout the Cloud Adoption Framework guidance, we have added references to show the important role that partners play and how customers can better engage partners. For a list of validated CAF partners, see the [CAF-aligned partner offers](https://aka.ms/adopt/partneroffers), [Azure Expert Managed Service Providers (MSPs)](https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/azureexpertmsp?filters=all), or [Advanced specialist partners](https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/advspec).

## May 15, 2020

Continued iteration of refinement to the Migrate methodology and the Ready methodology, to more tightly align them with feedback from Microsoft customers, partners, and internal programs.

### Migrate updates

| Article                                                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [Migrate methodology](../migrate/index.md)                       | These changes streamline the phases of the migration effort (assess workloads, deploy workloads, and release workloads). The changes also remove the details regarding the migration backlog. Removing those details and referencing plan, ready, and Adopt methodologies instead creates flexibility for various different cloud adoption programs to better align with the methodology. |
| Updated table of contents | The table of contents for the Azure migration guide and process improvements have been updated to reflect the changes to the methodology. |
