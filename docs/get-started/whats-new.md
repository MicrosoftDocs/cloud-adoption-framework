# What's new in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

We build the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework collaboratively with our customers, partners, and internal Microsoft Teams. We release new and updated content for the framework as it becomes available. These new releases pose an opportunity for you to test, validate, and refine the Cloud Adoption Framework guidance along with us.

Partner with us in our ongoing effort to develop the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## February 2023

### CAF relocate

The new relocate guidance details the process of moving a workload hosted in Azure to a different Azure region. Relocate walks you through five steps (initiate, evaluate, select, migrate, cutover) and shows you how to pick the right relocation strategy for each workload you want to move. For more information, see [Relocate overview](../relocate/index.md).

### Why update your Azure landing zones

An Azure landing zone is a set of predefined Azure resources and configurations that provide a foundation for a cloud-based application or workload. It's important that your deployed landing zone environment is kept up to date so you can maintain improved security, avoid platform configuration drift, and stay optimized for new feature releases. Explore the benefits of [keeping your Azure landing zone updated, secure, and optimized](../govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date.md).

### Migrate Azure landing zone policies to Azure built-in policies

Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives might be deprecated or superseded by Azure built-in policies over time. If so, they should be removed or migrated. Explore how to [migrate Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives to Azure built-in policies](../govern/resource-consistency/migrate-azure-landing-zone-policies.md).

### Update Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives

Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives update to newer versions that can then incorporate into an Azure environment. Learn how to [update your Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives when newer versions release](../govern/guides/standard/update-custom-policies.md).

### Azure App Service Cloud Adoption Framework design guidelines for the App Service landing zone accelerator

### Defense cloud adoption scenario

The Defense cloud adoption scenario provides universal guidance to help mission owners accelerate digital transformation. The guidance is impartial to country and collects best practices from our experience working with defense organizations around the world. Mission owners face unique challenges that are uncommon in other sectors. The Defense cloud adoption scenario provides recommendations to help navigate those challenges so mission owners can focus on meeting mission objectives.

We invite you to [explore the Defense cloud adoption scenario](../scenarios/defense/index.md) and return to this content regularly throughout your journey. The content highlights critical areas of focus but also refers you to other documentation for deeper technical insight. The result should be a secure, scalable, and governed environment that is tailored to mission needs.

### HPC landing zone accelerator

High-performance computing (HPC) on Azure is the complete set of Azure resources (compute, networking, and storage) integrated with workload orchestration services. HPC on Azure supports applications that provide advanced analytics, graphic-intensive visualizations, and scalable rendering. HPC can run complex simulations for organizations in multiple industries such as manufacturing, energy, and finance.

The HPC landing zone accelerator modernizes HPC workloads on Azure by offering global regulatory compliance, next-generation machine-learning tools, and a well-architected framework for best practices.

### Security control mapping with Azure landing zones

Many organizations are required to comply with regulations that govern their industry or location before adopting cloud services. Our best-practice recommendation is to [map required compliance controls to Azure Security Benchmark](../ready/control-mapping/security-control-mapping.md), which provides a set of cloud-centric security controls based on widely used compliance control frameworks.

Mapping required controls to Azure Security Benchmark can greatly expedite a secure Azure onboarding experience. The article also provides guidance on how to build policies and initiatives for controls that aren't covered by Azure Security Benchmark.

### Updates to Azure landing zone content in the Ready methodology

We've refined the flow for finding the right landing zone implementation, and we've added more content for all design areas.

We've consolidated guidance into a comprehensive set across environment and compliance design areas, making it easier to find the right information. We've created a clearer flow for organizations to work through during the design phase, before deploying a landing zone. Read more about [Azure landing zone design areas](../ready/landing-zone/design-areas.md).

Finally, we've added an example alignment scenario to the Align on-ramp: [Scenario: Transition existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](../ready/landing-zone/align-scenarios.md).
