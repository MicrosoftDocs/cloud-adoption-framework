### Security control mapping with Azure landing zones

Many organizations are required to comply with regulations that govern their industry or location before adopting cloud services. Our best-practice recommendation is to [map required compliance controls to Azure Security Benchmark](../ready/control-mapping/security-control-mapping.md), which provides a set of cloud-centric security controls based on widely used compliance control frameworks.

Mapping required controls to Azure Security Benchmark can greatly expedite a secure Azure onboarding experience. The article also provides guidance on how to build policies and initiatives for controls that aren't covered by Azure Security Benchmark.

### Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology

This Cloud Adoption Framework release introduces the new Secure methodology, which centralizes the theme of security best practices and provides end-to-end guidance for customers looking to adopt Microsoft guidance for their cloud environments. Security concerns have recently surged to the forefront of many top priorities lists. Building on feedback requesting a more security-centric view, the [Secure methodology](../secure/index.md) helps you define the security aspect of your cloud journey.

### Azure Virtual Desktop adoption journey

As part of the ongoing series of adoption journeys, this release includes expanded guidance for [integrating Azure Virtual Desktop (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop) into your cloud adoption journey](../scenarios/wvd/index.md). This rich guidance shows how each methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework helps provide structure and best practices to your implementation approach.

### Cloud economics updates

### Cloud service controls

To help you implement cloud governance at a pace that sustains a high level of innovation and implements the appropriate level of control for your environment, we've added a new article, [Implement cloud service controls](../govern/cloud-service-controls.md).

Enterprises of any size can implement the process at any stage of their cloud journey. This guidance outlines the different stages of the process, from taking the enterprise requirements for cloud control for security, operations, and cost management, through the stages of development and release of controls.
