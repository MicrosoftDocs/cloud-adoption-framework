The [updates to the Network topology and connectivity for Azure Virtual Desktop article](../scenarios/azure-virtual-desktop/eslz-network-topology-and-connectivity.md) describe two new scenarios to help you understand how to manage network topology and connectivity at scale in Azure Virtual Desktop. The first scenario describes a hub-and-spoke architecture with hybrid connectivity over managed networks. The second scenario describes a hub-and-spoke architecture with public networks. Both scenarios use Remote Desktop Protocol Shortpath (RDP Shortpath).

### Azure VMware Solution network design guides

These guides describe the Microsoft-recommended approach to help you design network connectivity for Azure VMware Solution private clouds. They explore four design areas: connectivity with on-premises sites, connectivity with Azure virtual networks, inbound internet connectivity, and outbound internet connectivity. Each design area is covered in a dedicated article, which presents architectural options, including their pros and cons. There are also two articles that cover the basics of Azure VMware Solution networking and guidance on how to prioritize requirements and related design areas.
