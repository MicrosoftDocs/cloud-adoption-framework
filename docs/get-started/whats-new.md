### Why update your Azure landing zones?

An Azure landing zone is a set of predefined Azure resources and configurations that provide a foundation for a cloud-based application or workload. It's important that your deployed landing zone environment is kept up to date so you can maintain improved security, avoid platform configuration drift, and stay optimized for new feature releases. Explore the benefits of [keeping your Azure landing zone updated, secure, and optimized](../govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date.md).

### Migrate Azure landing zone policies to Azure built-in policies

Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives might be deprecated or superseded by Azure built-in policies over time. If so, they should be removed or migrated. Explore how to [migrate Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives to Azure built-in policies](../govern/resource-consistency/migrate-azure-landing-zone-policies.md).

### Update Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives

Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives update to newer versions that can then incorporate into an Azure environment. Learn how to [update your Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives when newer versions release](../govern/guides/standard/update-custom-policies.md).

### Cloud adoption scenario for defense

The cloud adoption scenario for defense provides universal guidance to help mission owners accelerate digital transformation. The guidance is impartial to country/region and collects best practices from our experience working with defense organizations around the world. Mission owners face unique challenges that are uncommon in other sectors. The defense scenario provides recommendations to help navigate those challenges so mission owners can focus on meeting mission objectives.

We invite you to [explore the defense scenario](../scenarios/defense/index.md) and return to this content regularly throughout your journey. The content highlights critical areas of focus but also refers you to other documentation for deeper technical insight. The result should be a secure, scalable, and governed environment that is tailored to mission needs.

### HPC landing zone accelerator
