# Get started with the Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework can help you get started with several different getting started guides. This article groups the guides to help you find the one that best aligns with your current challenges.

<br>

Each of the following links takes you to questions that are typically asked when an organization is trying to accomplish a certain goal during their cloud adoption journey.

- [Choose the cloud adoption scenario that best supports your strategy](#cloud-adoption-scenarios)
- [Examine antipatterns across methodologies and their solutions](#cloud-adoption-antipatterns)
- [Align foundational concepts to onboard a person, project, or team](#align-foundation)
- [Adopt the cloud to deliver business and technical outcomes sooner](#accelerate-adoption)
- [Improve controls to ensure proper operations of the cloud](#improve-controls)
- [Establish teams to support adoption and operations](#establish-teams)

## Cloud adoption scenarios

Your organization's cloud adoption effort should support long-term strategic goals for your cloud journey. Depending on whether you're considering a comprehensive hybrid and multicloud effort, preparing for Kubernetes and container integration into your cloud strategy, or designing a cloud adoption journey for a retail business, we have updated guidance for these scenarios and more.

## Cloud adoption antipatterns

You might encounter missteps with design, planning, or implementation when migrating to the cloud. We have updated detailed guidance on [antipatterns](../antipatterns/antipatterns-to-avoid.md), that can block innovation and prevent businesses from adopting and realizing goals.

## Align foundation

Your company's cloud adoption journey is guided with foundational decisions that affect the outcomes of your cloud adoption journey. The following information can help you make core decisions, and record them as a reference to be used during the cloud adoption lifecycle.

- [How does Azure work](./what-is-azure.md)
- [Fundamental concepts](../ready/considerations/fundamental-concepts.md)
- [Portfolio hierarchy](../reference/fundamental-concepts/hosting-hierarchy.md)
- [Azure hierarchy support](../reference/fundamental-concepts/hierarchy-azure-tools.md)
