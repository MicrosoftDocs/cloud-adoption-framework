# Cloud Adoption Framework roadmap

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure and use technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all aspects of technology, from infrastructure to software. The cloud allows enterprises to provision and to consume resources only as needed. However, cloud adoption is a means to an end. Businesses adopt the cloud when they realize it can address any of these business opportunities:

- Businesses are motivated to **migrate** to the cloud to:
  - Optimize operations
  - Simplify technology
  - Increase business agility
  - Reduce costs
  - Prepare for new technical capabilities
  - Scaling to market demands or new geographical regions
- Businesses are motivated to **innovate** using the cloud to:
  - Improve customer experiences
  - Increase customer engagements
  - Transform products
  - Prepare for and build new technical capabilities
  - Scale to market demands or new geographical regions

## Vision and objectives

Removing key obstacles and enabling change requires more than implementation guidance. The Cloud Adoption Framework is a set of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices, and tools that help align strategies for business, culture, and technology to enable the desired business outcomes. Its modular structure guides the customer through their cloud journey. The Cloud Adoption Framework can stand by itself and provide self-service structured guidance for customers. The Cloud Adoption Framework builds on existing guidance whenever possible to meet the following objectives:

- **Technical strategy objective:** Establish scalable technical strategies, beyond a minimum viable product, so customers can easily customize and adapt to meet their needs and address common constraints.
- **Business strategy objective:** Without defining business strategy in this guidance, we will help architects understand, document, and communicate the business strategy so the right decisions can be made.
- **Culture strategy objective:** While not providing deep guidance on facilitating culture or organizational change, we will provide methodologies, scenarios, and questions that will help identify and remove cultural roadblocks to the technical strategy.

## Fulfilling the vision

The Cloud Adoption Framework is an overarching framework that covers Plan, Ready, and Adopt phases across the Migration and Innovation motivations for cloud adoption, supported by Governance and Operations guidance.

The framework has reached general availability (GA). However, we are still actively building this framework in collaboration with customers, partners, and internal teams. To encourage partnership, content is released as it becomes available. These public releases enable testing, validating, and incrementally refining the guidance.

To successfully adopting the cloud, a customer must prepare its people, technologies, and processes for this digital transformation. The Cloud Adoption Framework includes a section outlining the overall adoption journeys, both Migration and Innovation, as an overview for the customers. This section is composed of the following adoption journey phases:

- **Plan:** Align business outcomes to actionable technology backlogs. This phase consists of three areas of early stage planning activities:
  - Define the business justification and business outcomes.
  - Prioritize workloads based on impacts to the business outcomes.
  - Create a cloud adoption plan based on the current digital estate and prioritized workloads.
- **Ready:** Prepare the people, culture, and environment for change. This phase has three key components:
  - Create a cloud strategy team and other organizational alignment.
  - Create a skills readiness plan across roles and functions.
  - Establish an Azure foundation by preparing the cloud environment.
- **Adopt:** Implement the desired changes across IT and business processes to help customers realize their business, technology, and people strategies. This phase includes several areas that will vary depending on what the organization is implementing:
  - Migration of workloads and assets.
  - Apps and data modernization.
  - Cloud governance.
  - Management and operation of assets and workloads in the cloud.

These phases are not linear and will likely become a cycle, with customers revisiting and expanding adoption plans as their people become more cloud proficient and their apps and workloads are properly managed and operated, aligned with corporate policies, and deliver on their business outcomes.
