# Cloud adoption

The Adopt methodology shows you how to migrate, modernize, innovate, and relocate workloads in Azure. These four processes align to different phases in the cloud adoption journey. Each phase has distinct goals, solutions, and benefits. This article provides an overview of each process, so you can find the right guidance.

## Migrate

Migration is when you move workloads to the cloud. Different types of migration exist, and the migrate guidance shows you how to pick the migration strategy that aligns with your objectives.

- ***Goals:*** Meet business demands, exit on-premises environment, and align to Well-Architected Framework principles.

- ***Solutions:*** Adopt cloud solutions based on business need.

- ***Key benefits:*** Improve security, reliability, performance, and operations with managed solutions. Easily integrate new solutions and design patterns. No need to acquire, manage, and secure hardware.

For more information, see [Migrate](../migrate/index.md).

## Modernize

Modernization enhances existing workloads to improve operations, increase efficiency, maximize developer velocity, and reduce the total cost of ownership. Generally, modernization moves toward platform as a service (PaaS) solutions to improve your business at scale.

- ***Goals:*** Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms.

- ***Solutions:*** Integrate other services and modify code meet business goals.

- ***Key benefits:*** Optimize cost, security, reliability, performance, and operations for increased productivity. You don't need to maintain the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on your core business.

For more information, see [Modernize](../modernize/index.md).

## Innovate

Innovation is when you adopt cloud-native technologies to create customer-focused solutions that rapidly transform business outcomes.

- ***Goals:*** Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.

- ***Solutions:*** Adopt data and application capabilities to empower adoption and build predictive tools.

- ***Key benefits:*** Improve predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.

For more information, see [Innovate](../innovate/index.md).

## Relocate

Relocation is when you move an Azure workload to a different region in Azure. You can relocate a workload anytime after migration. Relocation evaluations should be a regular part of your workload lifecycle so your workload evolves with your business needs.

- ***Goals:*** Respond to business changes and expand your global footprint, meet data sovereignty and residency requirements, and provide lower latency to end users.

- ***Solutions:*** Adopt the location, services, and capabilities of a new Azure region.

- ***Key benefits:*** Respond to business changes, expand global footprint, meet data sovereignty and residency requirements, provide lower latency to end users.

For more information, see [Relocate](../relocate/index.md).
