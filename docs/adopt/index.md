# Adopt the cloud

Adopt the cloud to improve your business or organization. The adopt methodology is where you start using the cloud and experiencing its benefits.

There are three common approaches for adopting the cloud: migration, modernization, and innovation. Each approach has different solutions and provides unique benefits. The approach you take depends on the goals you have for cloud adoption (*see figure*).

Here's a brief overview of each approach to get you started. Focus on the goals of each approach. If they align with your cloud adoption goals, then explore that approach further to find implementation guidance.

## Migrate

The migrate approach is where you move your workloads to the cloud. Different forms of migration exist, but we'll focus on rehosting. Rehosting is also known as the "lift-and-shift" approach. In this approach, you move an existing workload to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions in the cloud and don't modify the workload.

- *Goals:* Quickly exit on-premises, enhance security, and improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Adopt IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Key benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance. You don't have to worry about acquiring, managing, and securing hardware.
- *Example:* Migrate applications from on-premises to IaaS solutions in the cloud.

## Modernize

The modernize approach is where you enhance existing applications to improve operations, increase efficiency, maximize developer velocity, and reduce the total cost of ownership. Modernizing uses managed platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS) to improve your business at scale.

- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms.
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance, and operations. You don't have to manage the underlying infrastructure and can focus on scaling your business.
- *Examples*: Move to managed services. Move from SQL database to Azure SQL database. Containerize applications and migrate from virtual machines to Azure Kubernetes Service or Container Apps.

## Innovate

The innovate approach is where you adopt cloud-native technologies to create customer-focused solutions that rapidly transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Adopt data and application capabilities to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.

## Next steps

The adopt methodology will help you tailor your cloud adoption approach around your goals. With your goals at the center of each decision, you'll find concrete steps to adopt the cloud and transform your business. See how most businesses change their portfolios to adopt the cloud.
