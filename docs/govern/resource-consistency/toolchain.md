# Resource Consistency tools in Azure

[Resource consistency](./index.md) is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md). This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies related to the operational management of an environment, application, or workload. Within the Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance, the Resource Consistency discipline involves monitoring of application, workload, and asset performance. It also involves the tasks required to meet scale demands, remediate performance SLA violations, and proactively avoid performance SLA violations through automated remediation.

<!-- docsTest:ignore "conditional access to resources" -->

The following is a list of Azure tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support this discipline.

Along with these Resource Consistency tools and features, you will need to monitor your deployed resources for performance and health issues. [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) is the default monitoring and reporting solution in Azure. Azure Monitor provides features for monitoring your cloud resources. This list shows which feature addresses common monitoring requirements.

When planning your deployment, you will need to consider where logging data is stored and how you integrate cloud-based [reporting and monitoring services](../../decision-guides/logging-and-reporting/index.md) with your existing processes and tools.

> [!NOTE]
> Organizations also use third-party DevOps tools to monitor workloads and resources. For more information, see [DevOps tool integrations](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops-tool-integrations).
