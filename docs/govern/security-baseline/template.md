# Security Baseline discipline template

The first step to implementing change is communicating what is desired. The same is true when changing governance practices. The following template provides a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern security related issues in the cloud.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Security Baseline policy statements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Security Baseline discipline within your cloud governance strategy.
