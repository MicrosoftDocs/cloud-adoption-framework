# Govern overview



:::image type="content" source="./images/govern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing the process to set up and maintain cloud governance. The diagram shows five sequential steps: build a cloud governance team, document cloud governance policies, enforce cloud governance policies, and monitor cloud governance. The first step you perform once. The last four steps you perform once to set up cloud governance and continuously to maintain cloud governance." lightbox="./images/govern.svg" border="false":::


1. *Build a governance team*: Select a team of individuals to be responsible for cloud governance. The cloud governance team defines and maintains cloud governance policies while reporting on the overall progress of cloud governance.

2. *Assess cloud risks*: Evaluate and prioritize potential risks associated with the use of the cloud. The risk assessment should identify risks unique to your organization. Consider all categories of risk, such as regulatory compliance, security, operations, cost, data, resource management, and AI risks. Use Azure tools to help [assess cloud risks](./assess-cloud-risks.md#azure-facilitation-identifying-cloud-risks).

3. *Document cloud governance policies*: Define the cloud governance policies that dictate the acceptable use of the cloud. These cloud governance policies set out the rules and guidelines for cloud usage to minimize the identified risks.

4. *Enforce cloud governance policies*: Enforce compliance with the cloud governance policies using automated tools or manual procedures. The goal is to ensure that the use of cloud services is in line with the established cloud governance policies. Use Azure tools to help [enforce cloud governance policies](./enforce-cloud-governance-policies.md#azure-facilitation-enforcing-cloud-governance-policies-automatically).

5. *Monitor cloud governance*: Monitor cloud use and teams responsible for governance to ensure they're compliant with the cloud governance policies. Use Azure tools to help [monitor cloud governance](./monitor-cloud-governance.md#azure-facilitation-configuring-cloud-governance-monitoring) and [set up alerts for noncompliance](./monitor-cloud-governance.md#azure-facilitation-configuring-cloud-governance-alerts).
