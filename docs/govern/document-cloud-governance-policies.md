# Document cloud governance policies

This article shows you how to define and document cloud governance policies. Cloud governance policies specify what should or shouldn't happen in the cloud. The cloud governance team should create one or more cloud governance policies for each risk identified in the risk assessment. Cloud governance policies define the guardrails for interacting with and in the cloud.

## Define an approach for documenting cloud governance policies

Establish an approach for creating, maintaining, and updating the rules and guidelines that govern the use of cloud services. Cloud governance policies shouldn't be unique to a specific workload. The goal is to produce cloud governance policies that donâ€™t require frequent updates and that consider the effects of cloud governance policies across the cloud environment. To define a policy documentation approach, follow these recommendations:

- *Define standard governance language*. Develop a standard structure and format for documenting cloud governance policies. The policies must be a clear and authoritative reference for stakeholders.

- *Recognize the different scopes of governance*. Define and assign specific governance responsibilities tailored to the unique roles within your organization. For example, a developer governs application code. A workload team is responsible for a single workload, and the platform team is responsible for governance that workloads inherit.

- *Evaluate the broad effects of cloud governance*. Cloud governance creates friction. Find a balance between friction and freedom. Consider the effects of governance on workload architecture, software development practices, and other areas as you develop cloud governance policies. For example, what you allow or disallow determines workload architecture and affects software development practices.

## Define cloud governance policies

Create cloud governance policies that outline how to use and manage the cloud to mitigate risks. Minimize the need for frequent policy updates. To define cloud governance policies, follow these recommendations:

- *Use a policy ID*. Use the policy category and a number to uniquely identify each policy, such as *SC01* for the first security governance policy. Increment the identifier sequentially as you add new risks. If you remove risks, you can leave gaps in the sequence or use the lowest available number.

- *Include the policy statement*. Craft specific policy statements that address identified risks. Use definitive language such as *must*, *should*, *must not*, and *shouldn't*. Use the enforcement controls from the risk list as a starting point. Focus on outcomes rather than configuration steps. Name the tool required for enforcement so you know where to monitor compliance.

- *Include a risk ID*. List the risk in the policy. Associate every cloud governance policy to a risk.

- *Include the policy category*. Include governance categories, such as security, compliance, or cost management, into the policy categorization. Categories help with sorting, filtering, and finding cloud governance policies.

- *Include the policy purpose*. State the purpose of each policy. Use the risk or the regulatory compliance requirement the policy satisfies as a starting point.

- *Define the policy scope*. Define what and who this policy applies to, such as all cloud services, regions, environments, and workloads. Specify any exceptions to ensure there's no ambiguity. Use standardized language so it's easy to sort, filter, and find policies.

- *Include the policy remediation strategies*. Define the desired response to a violation of a cloud governance policy. Tailor responses to the severity of the risk, such as scheduling discussions for nonproduction violations and immediate remediation efforts for production violations.

## Distribute cloud governance policies

Grant access to everyone who needs to adhere to cloud governance policies. Look for ways to make adherence to the cloud governance policies easier for people in your organization. To distribute cloud governance policies, follow these recommendations:

- *Use a centralized policy repository*. Use a centralized, easily accessible repository for all governance documentation. Ensure all stakeholders, teams, and individuals have access to the latest versions of policies and related documents.

- *Create compliance checklists*. Provide a quick and actionable overview of the policies. Make it easier for teams to comply without having to navigate through extensive documentation. For more information, see the [example compliance checklist](./enforce-cloud-governance-policies.md#example-cloud-governance-compliance-checklists).

## Review cloud governance policies

Assess and update cloud governance policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective in governing cloud environments. Regular reviews help ensure that cloud governance policies align with changing regulatory requirements, new technologies, and evolving business objectives. When you review policies, consider the following recommendations:

- *Implement feedback mechanisms*. Establish ways to receive feedback on the effectiveness of cloud governance policies. Gather input from the individuals affected by the policies to ensure they can still do their job efficiently. Update governance policies to reflect practical challenges and needs.

- *Establish event-based reviews*. Review and update cloud governance policies in response to events, such as a failed governance policy, technology change, or regulatory compliance change.

- *Schedule regular reviews*. Regularly review governance policies to ensure they align with evolving organizational needs, risks, and cloud advancements. For example, include governance reviews in the regular cloud governance meetings with stakeholders.

- *Facilitate change control*. Include a process for policy review and updates. Ensure the cloud governance policies stay aligned with organizational, regulatory, and technological changes. Make it clear how to edit, remove, or add policies.

- *Identify inefficiencies*. Review governance policies to find and fix inefficiencies in cloud architecture and operations. For example, instead of mandating that each workload must use its own web application firewall, update the policy to require the use of a centralized firewall. Review policies that require duplicated effort and see if there's a way to centralize the work.
