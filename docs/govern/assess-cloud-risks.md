# Assess cloud risks

Once the governance team is in place, the next step is to identify and evaluate all significant risks associated with your organizationâ€™s use of the cloud. A "risk" in this context is any potential unwanted outcome, such as a security breach, compliance violation, service outage, or cost overrun, that could result from how the cloud is used. By assessing risks, the governance team gains the information needed to craft relevant policies in the next step. This risk assessment should be conducted initially during governance setup, and then revisited regularly and whenever major changes occur, like new projects, new threats, audits, and incidents.

## 1. Identify cloud risks

Begin by compiling a comprehensive list of risks that the organization faces in the cloud. Focus on risks of general applicability rather than extremely niche scenarios. You can start with obvious high-priority risks and expand the list over time.

1. **List all cloud assets.** List all your cloud assets so you can comprehensively identify the risks associated with them. For example, you can use the Azure portal, Azure Resource Graph, PowerShell, and Azure CLI to view all resources in a subscription.

2. **Discover cloud risks.** Develop a stable risk catalog to guide cloud governance policies. To prevent frequent adjustments, focus on general cloud risks, not risks unique to a specific workload. Start with high-priority risks and develop a more comprehensive list over time. Common categories of risk are regulatory compliance, security, operations, cost, data, resources, and AI. Include risks that are unique to your organization, such non-Microsoft software, partner or vendor support, and internal cloud competencies.

3. **Involve key stakeholders.** Gather input from diverse organizational roles (IT, security, legal, finance, and business units) to consider all potential risks. This collaborative approach ensures a holistic view of risks related to the cloud.

4. **Verify risks.** Engage external experts who possess a deep understanding of cloud risk identification to review and validate your risk list. These experts could be Microsoft account teams or specialized Microsoft partners. Their expertise helps confirm the identification of all potential risks and enhances the accuracy of your risk assessment.

### Azure facilitation: Identifying cloud risks

The following guidance is meant to help you identify cloud risks in Azure. It provides a sample starting point for major categories of cloud governance. Azure can help automate part of the process of finding risks. Use Azure tools such as Azure Advisor, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, Azure Service Health, and Microsoft Purview.

- **Identify regulatory compliance risks.** Identify risks of noncompliance with legal and regulatory frameworks affecting cloud data and operations. Know the regulatory requirements of your industry. Use the [Azure compliance documentation](/azure/compliance/) to start.

- **Identify security risks.** Identify threats and vulnerabilities that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cloud environment. Use Azure to assess your [cloud security posture](/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-cloud-security-posture-management) and detect [identity risks](/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection).

- **Identify cost risks.** Identify risks related to the costs of cloud resources. Cost-related risks include overprovisioning, underprovisioning, underutilization, and unexpected costs from data transfer fees or service scaling. Use a [cost assessment](/assessments/ad1c0f6b-396b-44a4-924b-7a4c778a13d3/) to identify cost risk. Use Azure to estimate costs with the [Azure pricing calculator](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/pricing-calculator). [Analyze and forecast](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis) costs on current resources. Identify [unexpected changes](/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/analyze-unexpected-charges) in cloud costs.

- **Identify operations risks.** Identify risks that threaten the continuity of cloud operations, such as downtime and data loss. Use Azure tools to identify risks to [reliability and performance](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

- **Identify data risks.** Identify risks related to data management within the cloud. Consider improper handling of data and flaws in data lifecycle management. Use Azure tools to help [identify data risks](/purview/purview-compliance) and [explore risks to sensitive data](/azure/defender-for-cloud/data-security-review-risks).

- **Identify resource management risks.** Identify risks stemming from the provisioning, deployment, configuration, and management of cloud resources. Identify risks to [operational excellence](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

- **Identify AI risks.** Regularly [red team language models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming). Manually test AI systems and supplement manual tests with [automated risk identification tools for AI](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT#python-risk-identification-tool-for-generative-ai-pyrit). Look for common [human-AI interaction failures](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/playbook/). Consider risks associated with use, access, and output of AI systems. Review the tenets of [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai) and the responsible AI [maturity model](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/).

## 2. Analyze cloud risks

Assign a qualitative or quantitative ranking to each risk so you can prioritize them by severity. Risk prioritization combines risk probability and risk impact. Prefer quantitative risk analysis over qualitative for more precise risk prioritization. To analyze cloud risks, follow these strategies:

### Evaluate risk probability

Estimate the quantitative or qualitative probability of each risk occurring per year. Use a percentage range (0%-100%) to represent annual, quantitative risk probability. Low, medium, and high are common labels for qualitative risk probability. To evaluate risk probability, follow these recommendations:

1. **Use public benchmarks.** Use data from reports, studies, or service-level agreements (SLAs) that document common risks and their occurrence rates.

2. **Analyze historical data.** Look at internal incident reports, audit logs, and other records to identify how often similar risks occurred in the past.

3. **Test control effectiveness.** To minimize risks, assess the effectiveness of current risk-mitigation controls. Consider reviewing control testing results, audit findings, and performance metrics.

### Determine risk impact

Estimate the quantitative or qualitative impact of the risk occurring on the organization. A monetary amount is a common way to represent quantitative risk impact. Low, medium, and high are common labels for qualitative risk impact. To determine risk impact, follow these recommendations:

1. **Conduct financial analysis.** Estimate the potential financial loss of a risk by looking at factors such as the cost of downtime, legal fees, fines, and the cost of remediation efforts.

2. **Conduct reputational impact assessment.** Use surveys, market research, or historical data on similar incidents to estimate the potential impact on the organization's reputation.

3. **Conduct operational disruption analysis.** Assess the extent of operational disruption by estimating downtime, loss of productivity, and the cost of alternative arrangements.

4. **Assess legal implications.** Estimate potential legal costs, fines, and penalties associated with noncompliance or breaches.

### Calculate risk priority

Assign a risk priority to each risk. Risk priority is the importance you assign to a risk so you know whether to treat the risk with high, medium, or low urgency. Risk impact is more important than risk probability since a high-impact risk can have lasting consequences. The governance team must use a consistent methodology across the organization to prioritize risk. To calculate risk priority, follow these recommendations:

1. **Use a risk matrix for qualitative assessments.** Create a matrix to assign a qualitative risk priority to each risk. One axis of the matrix represents risk probability (high, medium, low) and the other represents risk impact (high, medium, low). The following table provides a sample risk matrix:

    |                      | Low impact      | Medium impact   | High impact     |
    |----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
    | **Low probability**  | Very low        | Moderately low  | Moderately high |
    | **Medium probability**| Low            | Medium          | High            |
    | **High probability** | Medium          | High            | Very high       |

2. **Use formulas for quantitative assessments.** Use the following calculation as a baseline: *risk priority = risk probability x risk impact.* Adjust the weight of the variables as needed to tailor the risk priority results. For example, you could put more emphasis on the risk impact with this formula: *risk priority = risk probability x (risk impact x 1.5).*

### Assign a risk level

Categorize each risk into one of three levels: major risks (level 1), subrisks (level 2), and risk drivers (level 3). Risk levels allow you to plan an appropriate risk management strategy and anticipate future challenges. Level 1 risks threaten the organization or technology. Level 2 risks fall under the level 1 risk. Level 3 risks are trends that could potentially culminate in one or more level 1 or level 2 risks. For example, consider noncompliance with data protection laws (level 1), improper cloud storage configurations (level 2), and increasing complexity of regulatory requirements (level 3).

### Determine risk management strategy

For each risk, identify appropriate risk treatment options, such as avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or accepting the risk. Provide an explanation of the choice. For example, if you decide to accept a risk because the cost of mitigating it's too expensive, you should document that reasoning for future reference.

### Assign risk owners

Designate a primary risk owner for every risk. The risk owner has the responsibility of managing each risk. This person coordinates the risk management strategy across every team involved and is the initial point of contact for risk escalation.

## 3. Document cloud risks

Document each risk and the details of the risk analysis. Create a list of risks (risk register) that contains all the information you need to identify, categorize, prioritize, and manage risks. Develop standardized language for risk documentation so everyone can easily understand the cloud risks. Consider including these elements:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| ID | A unique identifier for each risk. It ensures traceability and simple reference. Use a sequential label (for example, R01, R02); increment the sequence when you add a risk and leave gaps when you remove risks or renumber only when necessary. |
| Management status | The current status of the risk. It clarifies whether the risk requires action. Use "Open" or "Closed" and update the status immediately when it changes. |
| Category | A label that classifies the risk. It groups risks for targeted governance and reporting. Use categories such as Regulatory compliance, Security, Cost, Operations, AI, or Resource management. |
| Description | A brief, specific description of the risk. It explains the threat, affected assets, and scope. State the risk in one sentence and include the cause or entry point. |
| Probability | The annual probability that the risk occurs. It supports quantitative prioritization and comparison. Use a percentage (0%â€“100%) or a qualitative label (Low, Medium, High). |
| Impact | The consequence to the organization if the risk occurs. It informs remediation effort and cost estimation. Use a monetary estimate or a qualitative label (Low, Medium, High) and document the basis for the estimate. |
| Priority | The calculated severity that combines probability and impact. It directs the order of treatment and resource allocation. Use a dollar amount or qualitative label and record the calculation method (for example, probability Ã— impact). |
| Level | The risk tier within the risk hierarchy. It defines escalation paths and governance scope. Use Major threat (level 1), Subrisk (level 2), or Risk driver (level 3). |
| Management strategy | The chosen approach to handle the risk. It defines the primary action and expected outcome. Use actions such as Mitigate, Accept, Avoid, or Transfer and explain the rationale for the choice. |
| Management enforcement | The controls and processes that implement the strategy. It ensures the strategy executes and remains effective. List specific technical controls, policies, monitoring, and review cadence. |
| Owner | The individual or role accountable for managing the risk. It assigns responsibility and a single point of contact. Record the ownerâ€™s role or name, contact details, and escalation instructions. |
| Closure date | The target date to apply the management strategy or close the risk. It creates a deadline for accountability and tracking. Set a date and update it when the risk closes or the plan changes. |

## 4. Communicate cloud risks

Clearly convey identified cloud risks to the executive sponsor and executive-level management. The goal is to ensure the organization prioritizes cloud risks. Provide regular updates on cloud risk management and communicate when you need extra resources to manage risks. Promote a culture where managing cloud risks management and governance is a part of daily operations.

## 5. Review cloud risks

Review the current cloud risk list to ensure it's valid and accurate. Reviews should be regular and also in response to specific events. Maintain, update, or remove risks as needed. To review cloud risks, follow these recommendations:

- **Schedule regular assessments.** Set a recurring schedule to review and assess cloud risks, such as quarterly, biannually, or yearly. Find a review frequency that best accommodates personnel availability, the rate of cloud environment changes, and organizational risk tolerance.

- **Conduct event-based reviews.** Review risks in response to specific events, such as the failed prevention of a risk. Consider reviewing risks when you adopt new technologies, change business processes, and discover new security threats events. Also consider reviewing when technology, regulatory compliance, and organizational risk tolerance changes.

- **Review cloud governance policies.** Keep, update, or remove cloud governance policies to address new risks, existing risks, or outdated risks. Review the cloud governance policy statement and cloud governance enforcement strategy as needed. When you remove a risk, evaluate if the cloud governance policies associated with it are still relevant. Consult with stakeholders to remove the cloud governance policies or update the policies to associate them with a new risk.
