# Cost Management discipline template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The following template serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern cost management issues in the cloud.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Cost Management policy statements.
