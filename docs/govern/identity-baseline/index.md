# Identity Baseline discipline overview

Identity baseline is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md) within the [Cloud Adoption Framework governance model](../index.md).

Identity services provide the core mechanisms supporting access control and organization within IT environments, and the Identity Baseline discipline complements the [Security Baseline discipline](../security-baseline/index.md) by consistently applying authentication and authorization requirements across cloud adoption efforts.

## Manage identity baseline

In this discipline, you'll learn about the benefits of using Microsoft Entra ID as the centralized identity and authentication system for your organization. You will relearn about the identity management tools that are available to you for user management and access control that reduce the risks of user access to your applications. For each area, you'll receive prescriptive guidance on what to govern, and how to audit compliance with standards.

Consider the identity baseline guidance for the following areas.

- [Microsoft Entra configuration](azure-ad-configuration.md)
- [Administrative access](administrative-access.md)
- [Business user access](business-user-access.md)
- [Application access](application-access.md)
