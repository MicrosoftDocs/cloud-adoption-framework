# Network topology and connectivity for Oracle Database@Azure - Application connectivity design

This article builds on the core network concepts for Oracle Exadata Database@Azure. It describes best practices for how to configure and manage Azure networking to connect your application tier to Oracle Exadata Database@Azure.

## Locate application tiers

Use one of the following methods to position the application tier in an architecture design.

- **Colocate in the same virtual network:** Place application and database tiers in a single virtual network.

- **Deploy in a separate virtual network and connect via virtual network peering:** Place application and database tiers in distinct virtual networks that connect via peering.

The colocated approach provides simpler management and no extra peering costs, but might be less flexible if multiple teams or applications need separate networks. The following diagram shows the database and application tiers colocated in the same virtual network.

The peered virtual network approach adds virtual network peering costs and more complexity, but provides better isolation, independent scalability, and governance boundaries. This approach can also improve your security posture by providing more granular access control over the resources and enhanced network segmentation. The following diagram shows the database and application tiers in directly peered virtual networks.

In a full mesh pattern, each application virtual network is directly peered to the database virtual network. Application and database virtual networks connect to a hub network for shared services like firewalls or Domain Name System (DNS). This design helps ensure low-latency direct communication while enabling centralized traffic inspection and management. The following diagram shows a full mesh pattern among database, application, and hub virtual networks.

This pattern helps ensure direct connectivity from database and application virtual networks and protection from other networks.

## Design considerations

- **Cost factors:** Colocating the database and application tiers in the same virtual network incurs no extra network costs.

- **Connectivity options:** When you can't colocate the database and application tiers in the same virtual network, you can peer between virtual networks or traverse through a hub virtual network, like a standard virtual network or Azure Virtual WAN hub.

- **Known limitations:** Because of connectivity limitations from Oracle Database@Azure to private endpoints and serverless applications like Azure Functions, connectivity to these services requires an intermediate hop through a routing device like Azure Firewall or a non-Microsoft network virtual appliance.

- **Availability zone validation:** If you deploy the application tier in a separate subscription from the subscription that hosts Oracle Database@Azure â€“ Exadata Database Service, logical availability zones might differ from physical availability zones across subscriptions. To validate the correct availability zones, use the following command and replace `eastus` with your desired region:

  ```bash
  az rest --method get --uri '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/locations?api-version=2022-12-01' \
    --query 'value' | jq '.[] | .availabilityZoneMappings | .[]? | select(.physicalZone | contains("eastus"))'
  ```

## Design recommendations

- **Optimize for bandwidth and latency:** Colocate workload-related resources within the same availability zones to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

- **Optimize for smaller workload scopes:** Colocate applications and databases in the same virtual network if you have a limited number of Oracle databases that serve a small application portfolio that a single team manages. This approach reduces latency and simplifies the network design.

- **Use segmentation for complex environments:** For larger or more complex environments, treat Oracle Exadata Database@Azure as a dedicated service by deploying it in one or more dedicated subscriptions to manage multiple databases for different applications and teams. Deploy application solutions in separate subscriptions and use virtual network peering to connect the application networks to the database networks. This approach enables independent management of application and database resources while helping to maintain secure and performant connectivity.

## Next step

Now that you understand how to connect your application tier to Oracle Exadata Database@Azure, see the [BCDR connectivity design](./business-continuity-disaster-recovery-connectivity-design.md) guidance. This guidance helps you establish the required network foundations and best practices needed to support business continuity and disaster recovery strategies.
