# Enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator

This article describes enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator.

However, it's  important to understand decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to determine enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant outcomes.
