# Enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator

This article describes enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator. Azure landing zones for Oracle don't have specific  recommendations that impact [enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-microsoft-entra-tenant).

However, it's  important to understand decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to determine enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant outcomes.
