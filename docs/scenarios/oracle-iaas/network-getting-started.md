# Prepare for network connectivity for Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service

Before adoption begins, create a landing zone to host the workloads that you plan to build in or migrate to Azure. This section of the framework guides you through how to establish connectivity within your landing zone. This article builds upon the CAF [Network Landing Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/network-topology-and-connectivity) design principles.

The following articles help guide you through the process of creating a network connectivity and topology for your landing zone to support cloud adoption specific to Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service, Exadata Database Service.
