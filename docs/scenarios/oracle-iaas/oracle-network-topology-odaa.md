# Network Topology and Connectivity for Oracle Database@Azure - Getting started

Before you begin cloud adoption, create a landing zone to host the workloads that you plan to build in or migrate to Azure. This section of the framework guides you through how to establish connectivity within your landing zone. This article builds on the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure [network landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/network-topology-and-connectivity) design principles.

The following articles help guide you through the process of how to create a network connectivity and topology for your landing zone to support cloud adoption specific to Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service.

| **Design area**                 | **Objective**                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core network design             | Understand the foundational networking concepts for Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service.                                                        |
| Application connectivity design | Guidance on how to connect your application tier to Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service.                                                            |
| BCDR connectivity design        | Strategies for how to establish within-region and cross-region redundancy.                                                                                        |
| Migration connectivity design   | Approaches and best practices for how to integrate your current source environment with Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service for migration scenarios. |

## Next step

Start with the [Core network design](core-network-design.md) guidance, which introduces foundational networking principles and constraints for Oracle Database@Azure - Exadata Database Service. Complete this step before you explore application connectivity, BCDR, or migration scenarios.
