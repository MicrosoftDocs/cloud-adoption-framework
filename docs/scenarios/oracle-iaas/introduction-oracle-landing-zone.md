# Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator

Use the guidance in this article to set up and operate Oracle workloads inside your Azure Virtual Machines landing zone. The article provides a specific architectural approach and reference implementation for your Oracle database systems on Azure.

The implementation guidance in this article presupposes that you have implemented Azure landing zone in your environment. For more information, see [What is an Azure landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/implementation-options) and [Landing zone implementation options.](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/implementation-options).

## Adapt the architecture to your organization

Oracle on Azure landing zone architectures vary by organization. Technical considerations and design recommendations lead to configurations that are unique to your organization's specific scenario. The recommendations that this article describes should lead to an architecture that puts your organization on a path to sustainable scaling. 

## Design guidelines

As you plan the implementation of your Oracle landing zone, you need to make design decisions relating to several areas. These articles provide design guidelines and recommendations for each area:

- Enterprise enrollment
- Identity and access management
- Network topology and connectivity
- Resource organization
- Governance and compliance  
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Manage and monitor Oracle workloads
- Security guidance

## Architecture

You need to understand and plan for all critical areas of your landing zone architecture. This article describes the key components of the landing zone architecture in Azure for Oracle on IaaS.

## Azure landing zone architecture

The following diagram is a conceptual reference architecture that shows the critical design areas in an Oracle on Azure landing zone implementation.

:::image type="content" source="media/reference-architecture-oracle-landing-zone-accelerator.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a reference architecture of Oracle on Azure landing zone accelerator.":::

When developing a long-term vision for landing zones, consider the design of the landing zone implementation. Working within this scenario, you focus on the most appropriate starting point to meet your strategic and planning requirements for Oracle on Azure. This article is about the starting point, not necessarily all the details required to reach the longer-term target.  

## High-level Oracle landing zone architecture

Use the reference architecture as a starting point. You can download the [Visio file](https://github.com/jjaygbay1/specialized-workloads/blob/5a8cd70e9afb07be25c324cfbcb5cd4ee46d1937/Azure-Landing-Zone-Architecture-Oracle.vsdx) and modify it to fit your specific business and technical requirements when you plan your landing zone implementation.


As shown in  the reference architectural diagram, the Oracle databases are deployed on virtual machines. You can change the size and number of virtual machines to accommodate your organization's needs. The network layout in this example is simplified to demonstrate architectural principles and isn't intended to describe an entire enterprise network.

## Strategy and planning considerations for Oracle Virtual Machines landing zones  

Prioritization decisions made during [strategy](oracle-landing-zone-strategy.md) and [plan](oracle-landing-zone-plan.md) conversations have a direct impact on the most appropriate landing zone configuration to support your Oracle workloads implementations. What follows  are important questions to consider during the planning phase:  

- Will the initial deployment require mature processes for operations, security, and governance prior to launch?  
- What type of migration is planned, big bang or gradual switchover?  
- Does the migration plan require a smaller initial implementation of Oracle for POC, development, or testing efforts on a shorter timeline?  
- Are there business continuity requirements to consider during the migration?  

## Subscriptions

 For example, Oracle workload architecture uses the following three subscriptions:

- **An Azure virtual hub subscription** that contains the hub virtual network if necessary for hybrid connectivity. If your Oracle workloads are internet facing only, they may not require this specifically.  

- **An Azure Oracle production subscription**, where the production and disaster recovery systems are configured.  

- **An Azure Oracle non-production subscription**, where a nonproduction system includes a sandbox or development, quality assurance, or preproduction systems. This configuration is optional. You can use a subscription for each workload zone.

## Networking

For example, Oracle on Azure architecture is contained inside a single or two VNETs. This architecture can be used for either a hybrid connectivity scenario, or for scenarios where your Oracle workload isn't enabled for hybrid connectivity. For hybrid connectivity scenarios, the Oracle spoke virtual network should be connected to a hub virtual network in accordance with Azure landing zone accelerator general principles. You can connect either through regular peering or through Virtual WAN.  

The architecture subdivides the virtual network address space into subnets. You can associate each subnet with a network security group that defines the access policies for the subnet. Place application servers on a separate subnet so that you can more easily provide security for them.

You can manage the subnet security policies instead of managing individual servers. When you associate a network security group with a subnet, the network security group applies to all the servers in the subnet, and you have fine-grained control over the servers.

This architecture has three or four subnets, depending on the tier. For example, a production system might have the following four subnets.

- **Azure NetApp Files**: [A delegated subnet](/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet) for using Azure NetApp Files for different Oracle on Azure scenarios.

- **Azure Application Gateway**: A subnet that handles traffic coming from the internet.  

- **Oracle applications**: A subnet that contains Oracle application servers.

- **Database**: A subnet that contains only database virtual machines.

As Oracle Databases are backend services for a host of different applications with different architectures and requirements, more or less subnets may be required for your specific implementation. 

## Virtual machines and availability sets

For the basic HA configuration, the virtual machines in the Data Guard setup are grouped in an availability set. There's no charge for creating an availability set. You pay only for each virtual machine that you create.  Azure uptime SLA for virtual machines in an availability set is 99.95%.

For more information about Basic HA configuration, see the [Oracle BCDR documentation](oracle-disaster-recovery-oracle-landing-zone.md).

## Virtual machines and availability zones

An Azure availability zone is a unique physical location within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

For Oracle implementations latency between availability zones may be a concern, specifically regarding traffic between application servers and database servers if in different availability zones. The advanced HA/DR configuration places the database servers in different availability zones and possibly different regions.

Depending on the requirements of your application, you can  ensure that application servers are configured for zone redundancy. This configuration can be achieved through such technologies as [Virtual machine scale sets Flex](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes#scale-sets-with-flexible-orchestration), [Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery) or other options. This option also extends to other parts of the infrastructure such as Application Gateway, or ExpressRoute. The Azure uptime SLA for virtual machines configured for availability zones is 99.99%

For more information about advanced HA/DR configuration, see the [Oracle BCDR documentation](oracle-disaster-recovery-oracle-landing-zone.md).

## Azure NetApp Files and Azure Files

Azure NetApp Files and Azure Files with Network File System (NFS) provide high-availability file share services for Oracle database servers and redo log archiving.

Azure NetApp Files can host Oracle data and log files. Use this configuration for situations where performance requirements for the Oracle database installation exceed what is possible with managed disks.

[Azure Files](/azure/storage/files/) provides two main types of endpoints for accessing Azure file shares:

**Public endpoints** have a public IP address that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

**Private endpoints** are in a virtual network and have a private IP address within the address space of that virtual network.

It's recommended to apply [private endpoints](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-networking-overview#private-endpoints) where appropriate to route traffic from database server to Azure Files via [private link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).

## Landscape consolidation

Consider setting up landscape consolidation for nonproduction systems like sandbox and development environments. For example, consider different use cases:

Oracle database scenarios typically run an application and a database in separate virtual machines.

Oracle scenario might have two-tier deployments in which the Oracle application and database run on the same virtual machine. This configuration is more typical for dev/sandbox scenarios.

The components are separate in the example Oracle systems architecture to provide greater flexibility for maintenance, sizing, monitoring, and change control. Choose a design based on your requirements.

## Component information

The example architecture has components that you can use for Oracle operations. There are different strategies for [Backup services on Azure for Oracle database](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-strategies) that helps you to extend and improve your Oracle data platform with cloud-native Azure data services. A few of the backup recommendations are:

- [Azure storage-based backup and recovery](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-azure-storage?tabs=azure-portal)

- [Azure Backup services-based backup and recovery](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-azure-backup?tabs=azure-portal)

- [RMAN Based streaming backup](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-rman-streaming-backup?branch=pr-en-us-234143)

Apart from backup Azure provides methods for setting up [disaster recovery](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-disaster-recovery) capabilities for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines.

## Oracle landscape architecture examples  

The following reference architectures are an extension of the high-level architecture that appears earlier in this article.

:::image type="content" source="media/resource-group-oracle-landing-zone.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a basic high availability configuration of Oracle on Azure landing zone accelerator.":::

**Basic HA Configuration** - This is the most basic configuration for Oracle High availability inside a single availability zone. For more information on specific configuration, see [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator](oracle-disaster-recovery-oracle-landing-zone.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/resource-group-oracle-landing-zone-2.png" alt-text="Diagram showing an advanced high availability configuration of Oracle on Azure landing zone accelerator.":::

**Advanced HA/DR configuration** - This is the most advanced configuration for HA/DR using availability zones and regions. Extra configuration for HA/DR for application servers and frontend services are required as this isn't covered by the accelerator. Also note that this architecture is recommended to be combined with basic HA configuration for maximum availability in all scenarios.
