# Cloud adoption scenarios

The following scenarios unify technical and nontechnical considerations that your organization can use to accelerate its overall cloud adoption journey.

If you have a complex cloud adoption, you can follow trusted scenarios to narrow your focus to your requirements, which helps maximize your cloud investment. The scenarios include pointed guidance across several areas of cloud adoption best practices from the holistic and modular guidance of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. This article also references workload-specific architectural guidance from the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which contains reference architectures and example scenarios with deployment templates to help you implement solutions. These solutions are based on extensive customer experiences that represent an infrastructure that your organization can rely on.

Learn and benefit from a repository of successful cloud adoption experiences and best practices. This guidance includes collected and codified successful migration and modernization experiences across Microsoft customer communities and partner communities. Incorporate best practices that suit your cloud adoption.

## Components of a cloud adoption scenario

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-to-end-scenario-components.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the components of a cloud adoption scenario." lightbox="./media/end-to-end-scenario-components.png" border="false":::

The following list describes the components of a cloud adoption scenario:

- [The Cloud Adoption Framework](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/cloud-enablement/cloud-adoption-framework/) guides you through each consideration and implementation along the phases of your cloud adoption journey. Use the Cloud Adoption Framework across your organization to prepare decision makers, central IT, and the cloud center of excellence (CCoE) for your organization's cloud adoption efforts.

- [Microsoft Learn Training](/training) is a free online training platform. Learn new skills and discover the power of Microsoft products with step-by-step guidance. These modules include role-based training and learning paths for Azure developers, solution architects, and administrators.

- **Reference architectures** are templates that include required components and technical requirements to implement the components. Each reference architecture includes best practices and considerations for scalability, availability, security, resilience, and other aspects of design. Reference architectures can help your organization accelerate deployment for many common scenarios.

- [The Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) provides a set of Azure architecture best practices to optimize workloads and help you build and deliver great solutions. These best practices cover cost management, operational excellence, performance efficiency, reliability, and security. The Well-Architected Framework provides essential considerations for workload owners to review before they initiate their workload deployments.

- **Best practices** can help you build reliable, scalable, and secure applications in the cloud. Best practices provide guidelines and tips to implement efficient systems, mechanisms, and approaches.

- [Featured Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/category/) provide information about the products that support your Azure strategy. Use proven combinations of Azure products and services to solve your business problems. Get started with documentation and reference architectures, follow best practices guidance for scenarios, and implement solutions for common workloads on Azure.

## Scenarios to support your cloud adoption strategy

Each overview page provides guidance that you can use to implement the scenario in your cloud adoption strategy.

| Scenario| Description|
|--|--|
| [Azure VMware Solution](../scenarios/azure-vmware/index.md) | Use an Azure service that's built with VMware to migrate your VMware resources to a vSphere-based, single-tenant, private cloud on dedicated infrastructure. Extend hybrid and multicloud agility. Learn how to optimize costs and develop cloud skilling so that you can minimize negative effects on business continuity and reduce the overall migration time. |
| [Cloud-scale analytics](./data-management/index.md) | Ensure that your business data is discoverable, accurate, trusted, and protected. Scale complex data architectures within on-premises and multicloud scenarios without increased complexity. Enable common, self-serve data infrastructure, distributed architecture, secure network line of sight, and centralized data governance that's protected and reliable across deployments. You can process, deliver, and manage your mature data estate across deployments, migrate data platforms, democratize data, and extend workloads by using advanced cloud services. |
| [Hybrid and multicloud](./hybrid/index.md) | Confidently mature your analytics, AI, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in the cloud. Choose a unified operations approach to build, deploy, and migrate streamlined solutions across on-premises, multicloud, and edge environments. Modernize your existing on-premises investments, and gain the consistency and flexibility that you need to innovate across on-premises, multicloud, and edge environments. Manage and govern with a single control plane. Bring Azure services to any infrastructure. Extend compute storage to IoT devices, and run advanced machine learning analytics at the edge to gain real-time insights. |
| [Modern application platform](./app-platform/index.md) | Enable rapid innovation and workload portability with Kubernetes and container integration. Integrate platform as a service (PaaS) application services and containers into your strategy to maximize the value of cloud-enabled applications. Accelerate developer productivity by empowering developers to focus more on code and less on host environment concerns. Reduce operations costs with streamlined container orchestration and consistent runtimes. Modernize legacy workloads, and enable workload portability between container hosts across hybrid, multicloud, and edge environments with diverse container orchestration options. You can implement these changes before migration or modernization with customized application runtimes that are container host agnostic and meet legacy requirements in a cloud environment. |
| [Oracle](./oracle-iaas/index.md) | Accomplish your business goals by using the Oracle on Azure framework to migrate and manage Oracle workloads to different technology platforms on Azure. Engage in parallel conversations across Oracle and central IT teams to align your cloud adoption plan. Separate discovery processes during strategic alignment with business leadership, and plan to prepare current-state and future-state data. Prepare your team and environment for migration by integrating Azure landing zones with preconfigured approaches to rapidly deploy environments to various technology platforms. Demonstrate how an Oracle migration can integrate with repeatable migration processes. Show how a common operations baseline can address run-state concerns during migration and meet the operational needs of other technology platforms. |
| [SAP](./sap/index.md)| This scenario aligns with the Cloud Adoption Framework to help you migrate, innovate, and manage workloads and technology platforms and accomplish your business goals. Engage in parallel conversations across SAP and central IT teams to align your cloud adoption plan. Separate discovery processes into strategy during strategic alignment with business leadership, and plan to prepare current-state and future-state data. <br><br> Prepare your team and environment for migration by integrating Azure landing zones with preconfigured approaches to rapidly deploy environments to various technology platforms.
