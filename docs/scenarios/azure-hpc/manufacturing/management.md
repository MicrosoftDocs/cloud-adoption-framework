# Management for HPC in the manufacturing industry

Azure [landing zones for HPC](../ready.md) in the manufacturing industry don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that influence management decisions. Management is one of several design areas considered in this documentation.

## Previous recommendations 

Keep in mind that it could be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so you know about existing [management recommendations](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/management.md).
