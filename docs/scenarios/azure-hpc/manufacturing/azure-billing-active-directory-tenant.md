# Manufacturing HPC Azure billing and Active Directory tenants

Azure landing zones for HPC don't have specific considerations or recommendations that affect billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions.

But it might be important to understand decisions previously made by the cloud platform team and the existing [enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-microsoft-entra-tenant.md).
