# Platform automation and DevOps for HPC in the manufacturing industry 

Azure [landing zones for HPC](../ready.md) in the manufacturing industry don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect decisions related to platform automation and DevOps. Platform automation and DevOps are two of several design areas considered in this documentation.

## Previous recommendations 

Keep in mind that it could be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so you know about existing recommendations for [platform automation and DevOps](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/platform-automation-devops.md).

## Next steps

The following articles provide guidance that you might find helpful at various points during your cloud adoption process. They can help you succeed in the cloud adoption scenario for HPC in the manufacturing industry.
