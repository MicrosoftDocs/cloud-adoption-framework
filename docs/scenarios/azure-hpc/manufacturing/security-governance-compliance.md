# Azure governance for manufacturing HPC

Governance is an important part of planning for HPC workloads. Organizations in the manufacturing and automotive industries often rely on compliance and regulation assessments, like [Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-tisax).

Keep in mind that it could be important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team so that you're aware of existingâ€¯ governance recommendations.

## Azure governance in the Azure HPC landing zone accelerator

The Azure HPC landing zone accelerator can help your organization get mature governance controls.

For example:

- A management group hierarchy that groups resources by function or workload type might encourage best practices for resource consistency.
- A rich set of Azure policies might enable governance controls at management-group level to ensure all resources are in scope.
