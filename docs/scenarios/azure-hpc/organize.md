# Organize team members for Azure high-performance computing (HPC) in Azure

HPC architecture was designed with a set of core principles.

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Cloud Adoption Framework's Organize methodology](../../organize/index.md). Align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts.

## Core principles

- **Self-service enablement:** Enable project teams to work on their own to allow agile development methods.

- **Governance:** Enforce guardrails across the Azure platform to ensure that project teams only see, change, and execute the functions within their permissions.

- **Streamlined deployments:** Ensure that common policies are available within the organization to help teams scale quickly and support teams with less experience in some core designs and artifacts.

## Roles and teams

Devise a cloud adoption team to drive all HPC technical changes to have consistency to onboarding solutions into the cloud. Best practices include having a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes a cloud governance team to balance out the cloud adoption team by ensuring platform maturity, operations, governance, and automation.

Consider forming a cloud strategy team with both executive leadership and IT management for accountability of the cloud adoption lifecycle.

For more information, see [Mature Team Structures](../../organize/organization-structures.md).

## Deployment and operations

Establish coordination with your organization IT leaders and research teams to identify strong use cases only possible for HPC cloud when it comes to costing and needed performance. Use cases could be studying variations of a genetic disease in life and health sciences, automotive designers simulating the forces and stresses that impact vehicle safety operations, or the continual growing demands of AI computation.

Align responsibilities for your HPC environment by developing a cross-team matrix to identify responsibility, accountability, consultancy, and informed parties.

For more information, see [Align responsibilities across teams.](../../organize/raci-alignment.md)

## Next steps

- After devising your organizing strategy for your team members, you can refer back to the [HPC Landing Zone(s)](./ready.md) and map to your overall HPC environment's cloud adoption readiness.
