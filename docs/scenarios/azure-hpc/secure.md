# Secure Azure high-performance computing (HPC) in Azure

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Cloud Adoption Framework's Security methodology](../../secure/overview.md)

## Security principles

The focus of HPC is based on key management principles:

| Principle | Description |
|--|--|
| **Single authoritative source of identity**| Use consistency and a single authoritative source to increase clarity, and reduce the risk from human error and configuration and automation complexity. |
| **Automated approach to data security**| Use automation to enable auditing, implement multiple control points, and reduce human errors. Automation also makes data governance easier and limits overhead.|
| **Grant least privilege required to complete task**| Grant only the amount of access to users that they need to do their jobs and limit the allowed actions for a particular scope.|
|  **Simplified yet secure permissions**| Avoid customization. Customization leads to complexity, which inhibits human understanding, security, automation, and governance. For example, use built-in roles to assign permissions to data services and avoid permissions that specifically reference individual resources or users.|
| **Better clarity and enforceability of rules and definitions**| Clearly separate data to help keep the environment organized, while making it easy to enforce security rules and definitions. |

It is also recommended to follow the security baseline recommendations for the following HPC services:
- [Azure HPC Cache:](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-hpc-cache-security-baseline) Ensure that network security, identity management, privileged access, data protection, asset management, logging/threat detection, posture/vulnerability management, and backup/recovery is in place.
- [Azure CycleCloud:](/azure/cyclecloud/concepts/security-best-practices) Have your HPC administrator setup SSL, configure networking and secret management, and create a secure locked-down environment.
- [Azure Batch:](/azure/batch/security-controls-policy) Use the latest Azure Security Benchmarks available to implement recommendations on securing your Batch nodes based on the appropriate compliance standard.

## Next steps

- After creating your HPC cloud adoption security strategy, look into [organizing team members](./organize.md) to align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts.
- For additional security information, refer to best practices defined in the Azure [HPC Well-architected framework.](../azure-hpc/well-architected-framework.md#security)
