# Modernize your workloads for Azure high-performance computing (HPC)

Best practice for HPC encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Cloud Adoption Framework's Modernize methodology](../../modernize/index.md). Creating your centralized cloud adoption can improve operational efficiency, optimize your HPC costs, and allows your business or organization to be more productive with less. Modernize your strategy with the two recommended phases of business alignment and modernization strategies.

## HPC business alignment

Assess your HPC business goals with [alignment](../../modernize/business-alignment/index.md) before you commit to modernizing. Defining your business alignment is the process of identifying your modernization motivations and designing a roadmap around them. Align your modernization goals with the HPC workloads by envisioning your possibilities, evaluate the financial and technical readiness of each HPC workload you want to modernize, and commit to the modernization path you choose for all HPC resources.


## HPC modernization strategy

Use the framework [modernization](../../modernize/modernize-strategies/index.md) roadmap to guide you to the right cloud modernization strategies for your HPC environment.

Modernization strategy is defined as enhancing your HPC workloads and the process to support those workloads. For HPC in Azure, the process modernization strategy includes optimized performance with cost control.

While application and database modernization in the cloud includes adoption of PaaS solutions, HPC in Azure also offers flexible [self management](/azure/architecture/topics/high-performance-computing#do-it-yourself) configurations that allow setting up your own cluster environment, using ARM templates for workload manager deployment, infrastructure and applications, and defining your own VM sizes depending on the high performance workload requirements.

For connecting your existing on-premises HPC system to Azure, [hybrid and cloud bursting](/azure/architecture/topics/high-performance-computing#hybrid-and-cloud-bursting) resources are also available to help you get started.



## Next steps

- After strategizing the modernization of your HPC environment, define what your [migration](./migrate.md) process and path will consist of.
- For more information for connecting your existing on-premises HPC system to Azure, review the [options for connecting your on-premises network](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/) to Azure.
- Consider more design area options in [platform automation and devops recommendations](../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/platform-automation-devops.md) when evaluating further modernization strategies for your HPC environment.
