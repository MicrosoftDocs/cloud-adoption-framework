# Azure billing and Microsoft Entra tenants for energy HPC

Azure landing zones for HPC don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Active Directory tenant decisions.

## Previous recommendations

Keep in mind that it might be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so you know about existing [enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-microsoft-entra-tenant.md).
