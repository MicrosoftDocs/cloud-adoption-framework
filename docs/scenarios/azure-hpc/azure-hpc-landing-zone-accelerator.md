# Azure high-performance computing (HPC) landing zone accelerator

The high-performance computing (HPC) landing zone accelerator automates the deployment of an environment. This environment provides a base framework that you can customize to create an end-to-end deployment mechanism for a complete HPC cluster solution in Azure. The accelerator is a collection of open-source scripts & templates that can prepare your enterprise-scale landing zones. It can provide a specific architectural approach and a reference implementation that adhere to the architecture and best practices of the Cloud Adoption Framework. 

Customers adopt HPC in various ways to suit their business needs, and you can adapt the HPC landing zone accelerator to produce an architecture that fits *your* way. Using the accelerator helps to put your organization on a path to a sustainable scale.

## Implement an enterprise-scale landing zone

The HPC landing zone accelerator assumes that you're starting with an enterprise-scale landing zone that's been successfully implemented. For more information on this prerequisite, see the following articles:

- [Start with Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md)
- [Implement Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones in Azure](../../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md)

## What the HPC landing zone accelerator provides

The approach to landing zones of the HPC landing zone accelerator provides the following assets to your project:

- A modular approach, so that you can customize environment variables
- Design guidelines to aid in evaluating critical decisions
- The landing zone architecture
- An implementation that includes:
  - A deployable reference capable of creating the environment for your HPC deployment
  - A Microsoft-approved HPC reference implementation to test the deployed environment

## Design guidelines for energy, manufacturing, and finance

The architectures of landing zones vary by business sector, in addition to varying by organization. This section lists articles by sector that provide guidelines for creating your landing zone:
