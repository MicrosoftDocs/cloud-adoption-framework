# Storage for HPC in the finance sector

This article provides recommendations for implementing storage in HPC environments for the finance sector. Large-scale HPC workloads in finance environments create demands for data storage and access that exceed the capabilities of traditional cloud file systems.

## Design considerations

To decide which storage solution to use, you need to take into account the following application requirements.

 - Latency
 - IOPS
 - Throughput
 - File sizes and number
 - Job runtime
 - Associated costs
 - Affinity for storage location: on-premises versus Azure

## Design recommendations

- Use [Standard or Premium Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) for high-throughput, low-latency storage. It offers these benefits: 

   - It provides exabyte-scale, high-throughput, low-latency access where necessary, a familiar file system, and multi-protocol access (REST, HDFS, NFS).
   - It's cost effective.
   - You can mount Blob Storage as a file system by using [BlobFuse](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux). Doing so makes it easy to allow multiple nodes to mount the same container for read-only scenarios.
   - It supports NFS 3.0 at the blob service endpoint for high-throughput, read-heavy workloads.
   - You can  optimize costs by moving data to cooler tiers via the ability to perform lifecycle management with last update/access time intelligent tiering, with customizable policies.

- Use [Azure NetApp Files](/azure/azure-netapp-files) for ReadWriteMany (unique) or write-once, read-once applications. It provides these benefits: 

   - A wide choice of file protocols (NFSv3, NFSv4.1, SMB3).
   - Performance that's comparable with on-premises performance, with multiple tiers (Ultra, Premium, Standard).
   - Deploys in minutes and offers a wide range of tiers and flexibility.
   - Flexible capacity pool types and performance, where the QoS per volume is automatically assigned based on the tier of the pool and the volume quota.

The following table provides a comparison of Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Managed Lustre, and Azure NetApp Files.

|  | Blob Storage | Azure Files | Azure Managed Lustre | Azure NetApp Files |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **Use cases** | Best suited for large-scale read-heavy sequential access workloads where data is ingested once and minimally modified. <br><br> Low total cost of ownership, if there's light maintenance. | A highly available service that's best suited for random access workloads. <br><br> For NFS shares, Azure Files provides full POSIX file system support. The built-in CSI driver enables you to easily use it from container platforms like Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), in addition to VM-based platforms. | Azure Managed Lustre is a fully managed parallel file system best suited to medium to large HPC workloads. <br><br> Enables HPC applications in the cloud without breaking application compatibility by providing familiar Lustre parallel file system functionality, behaviors, and performance, securing long-term application investments. | A fully managed file service in the cloud, powered by NetApp, with advanced management capabilities. <br><br> Azure NetApp Files is suited for workloads that require random access. It provides broad protocol support and improved data protection. |
| **Available protocols** | NFS 3.0 <br><br>REST <br><br>Azure Data Lake Storage  | SMB <br><br> NFS 4.1 <br><br>(No interoperability between either protocol.) | Lustre | NFS 3.0 and 4.1 <br><br> SMB <br><br><br> |
| **Key features** | Integrated with Azure HPC Cache for low-latency workloads. <br><br> Integrated management, including lifecycle management, immutable blobs, data failover, and metadata index. | Zonally redundant for high availability. <br><br> Consistent single-digit millisecond latency. <br><br> Predictable performance and cost that scales with capacity. | High storage capacity up to 12.5 PiB upon request. <br><br> Low (~2ms) latency. <br><br> Spin up new clusters in minutes. <br><br> Supports containerized workloads with AKS. | Extremely low latency (as low as sub-millisecond). <br><br> Rich NetApp ONTAP management capability, like SnapMirror Cloud. <br><br> Consistent hybrid cloud experience. |
| **Performance (per volume)** | As much as 20,000 IOPS. As much as 100 GiB/s throughput. | As much as 100,000 IOPS. As much as 80 GiB/s throughput. | As much as 1M IOPS, up to 500 GiB/s throughput. | As much as 460,000 IOPS. As much as 36 GiB/s throughput. |
| **Scale** | As much as 2 PiB for a single volume. <br><br> As much as ~4.75 TiB for a single file. <br><br> No minimum capacity requirements. | As much as 100 TiB for a single volume. <br><br> As much as 4 TiB for a single file. <br><br> 100 GiB minimum capacity. | Up to 12.5 PiB upon request for a single volume. <br><br> As much as 31.25 PiB for a single file. <br><br> 4 TiB minimum capacity. | As much as 100 TiB for a single volume. <br><br> As much as 16 TiB for a single file. <br><br> Consistent hybrid cloud experience. |
| **Pricing** | [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs) | [Azure Files pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files) | [Azure Managed Lustre pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-lustre) | [Azure NetApp Files pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/netapp) |
