# Use the Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) landing zone accelerator to deploy scalable AKS clusters

The Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) landing zone accelerator defines a strategic design path and target technical state for deploying Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters in enterprise environments. This accelerator provides a modular, reference implementation that aligns with the Cloud Adoption Framework's Azure landing zones and design principles.

## Establish a platform foundation before deploying AKS

A platform foundation provides shared services such as networking, identity, security, and governance. This foundation supports consistent and secure AKS deployments across your environment.

1. **Implement a platform foundation using Azure landing zones.** Use the Cloud Adoption Framework's [Azure landing zone](../../../ready/landing-zone/index.md) guidance to deploy shared services that include identity providers, hub-and-spoke networking, and centralized policy enforcement. This foundation simplifies security and management across your cloud environment.

2. **Skip this step if your organization already has a platform foundation.** If you already have an Azure landing zone, proceed to deploy the AKS landing zone accelerator.

## Deploy the AKS landing zone accelerator

The AKS landing zone accelerator includes open-source templates and reference architectures that support scalable AKS deployments.

1. **Use the templates from the official GitHub repository.** Use the [AKS landing zone accelerator](https://aka.ms/aks-reference-implementation) repo to access ARM template, Bicep, and Terraform templates for deploying AKS infrastructure components fit your environment. Modify environment variables and parameters to align with your organizationâ€™s naming conventions, policies, and operational requirements.

2. **Deploy the accelerator in the landing zones management group.** Place the AKS workload in the appropriate subscription and management group to ensure alignment with platform governance and policy enforcement.

## Evaluate the AKS design areas

Design areas help you align your AKS implementation with Azure landing zone principles. Use the following guides to evaluate and configure each area:

- [Azure billing and Active Directory (if needed)](./azure-billing-ad-tenant.md)
- [Identity and access management](./identity-and-access-management.md)
- [Network topology and connectivity](./network-topology-and-connectivity.md)
- [Resource organization](./resource-organization.md)
- [Security](./security.md)
- [Management and business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR)](./management.md)
- [Platform automation and DevOps](./platform-automation-and-devops.md)
- [Storage](./storage.md)

## Example conceptual reference architecture

The conceptual reference architecture illustrates a golden state for AKS in an Azure landing zone. It shows how AKS integrates with shared services and aligns with the design areas.

    The diagram shows four management groups: platform subscriptions, sandbox subscriptions, decommissioned subscriptions, and application landing zone subscriptions. The AKS landing zone accelerator deploys to a subscription under the application landing zone management group. Customers connect to the AKS cluster through Azure Application Gateway, which is only accessible through a private virtual network. This private virtual network is peered with the hub connectivity subscription, which provides on-premises connectivity via ExpressRoute, VPN, and an Azure Firewall. The AKS cluster, User Node Pool, and System Node Pool are in a resource group with Azure Key Vault. A separate resource group contains Cosmos DB and MySQL databases behind a private endpoint. A third resource group is a Node Resource Group. The architecture includes Azure dashboards, recovery services vaults, shared services, Azure role-based access control assignments, Azure policy assignments, Network Watcher, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Monitor for Containers.
