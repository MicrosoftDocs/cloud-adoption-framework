# Management baseline considerations for an Azure Virtual Desktop

Achieve operational excellence and customer success by properly designing your Azure Virtual Desktop environment with management and monitoring in mind.

## Platform management and monitoring

Review the following considerations and recommendation for platform management and monitoring of Azure Virtual Desktop.

### Design considerations

- Use Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspaces as the administrative boundary of logs.
- Collect telemetry from the following platform services:
  - Workspaces
  - Host pools
- Performance counters should be collected.
- Azure event logs should be collected.
- Create a dashboard from the platform logs to centralize visuals for reporting operations.
- Learn to [use Azure Monitor for Azure Virtual Desktop to monitor your deployment](/azure/virtual-desktop/azure-monitor).

### Design recommendations

- Use a separate dedicated Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace for Azure Virtual Desktop.
- Centralize your Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace in the region of your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.
- Export diagnostic settings to a storage account if there's a need to go beyond the two-year retention period.
- Enable the platform service diagnostic telemetry stated in the considerations to go to the Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace.
- The following Windows performance counters should be collected by Log Analytics for Azure Virtual Desktop monitoring:

  <!-- docutune:enable -->

- Collect the following Windows event logs into the Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace.

   **Windows Event Log name**

  - `System`
    - `Application`
    - `Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational`
    - `Microsoft-FSLogix-Apps/Operational`
    - `Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Admin`
    - `Microsoft-FSLogix-Apps/Admin`

- Use [Azure Monitor for Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/azure-monitor) for ease of configuration.

- Assign application groups to user groups to ease your administration overhead.

- Application groups can be segregated in many ways. We recommend separating them based on which department or user type (for example, power, engineering, or general) the user is a part of.

## Infrastructure management and monitoring

Review the following considerations and recommendation for infrastructure management and monitoring of Azure Virtual Desktop.

### Design considerations: Infrastructure

- Use the same Log Analytics workspace that's used for the Azure Virtual Desktop platform.
- The session host performance counters are collected and logged.
- Use network performance monitoring for user experience management.
- Set up an alerting model around the collected logs and metrics.
- Use Windows Update Management for the session hosts between feature updates.

### Design recommendations: Infrastructure

- Use a centralized Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace in the region of your session hosts.
- Set up the performance counters according to the [documentation](/azure/virtual-desktop/azure-monitor#set-up-performance-counters).
- Set up the Network Performance Monitor in the same region as your Azure Virtual Network and session hosts.
- Incorporate Azure policies and governance for enterprise-scale into the Azure Virtual Desktop landing zone.
