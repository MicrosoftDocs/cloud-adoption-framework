# Azure Virtual Desktop planning

Azure Virtual Desktop deployment scenarios follow the same Migrate methodology as other migration efforts.

This consistent approach allows migration factories or existing migration teams to adopt the process with little change to non-technical requirements.

## Plan your migration

As with other migrations, your team will assess workloads, deploy them, and then release them to end users. However, Azure Virtual Desktop includes specific requirements that will necessitate a review of the Azure landing zones during the assessment of the workloads. The process will also require a proof of concept prior to the first deployment.

To build your plan, see the [cloud adoption plan DevOps template](../../plan/template.md) for an existing migration backlog in Azure DevOps. Use the template to create a detailed plan of activities.

## Business justification

Part of your planning requires articulating the business benefits of moving to Azure Virtual Desktop.

The following items should be included in a business case:

- The Azure Virtual Desktop control plane or management plane is provided as a service to customers. The control plane manages end users' seamless global connectivity into their desktop, and the centralized deployment and orchestration that IT requires. This is a platform as a service (PaaS) capability eliminating the need for procuring, deploying, patching, or supporting hardware. It's an evergreen service that you consume. It's a free service that you are entitled to via a license that you likely already own, helping you achieve cost savings through efficiency. Also, after migration you don't need to manage or troubleshoot an on-premises virtual desktop management service. This allows IT to focus on delivering business value, like providing customers with the best user experience possible when accessing applications and data.

- No upfront costs are incurred. Running an on-premises virtual desktop environment requires you to either upfront payment or a lengthy leasing agreement for the hardware required to meet the peak load. This requirement applies even if the hardware is not ultimately used as the project progresses, or if the hardware is not fully used when the project is complete. With Azure Virtual Desktop and Azure's consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use, and you can scale up and down based on your business needs, helping you reduce your costs.

- Like other Azure services, Azure Virtual Desktop have a quicker delivery cadence for new features and capabilities. On-premises hardware and off-the-shelf software typically don't provide large new feature sets or new capabilities as frequently, and often require a costly project to implement. Conversely, Azure services such as Azure Virtual Desktop regularly provide new capabilities, with deployment managed by Microsoft. Azure Virtual Desktop is an evergreen service. Organizations don't need a project to roll out new services to provide business users with new features. These new features could provide competitive advantage or reduce the risk of technical debt.

- Azure is a hyperscale cloud that provides services at massive scale. This functionality provides substantial agility to your organization. Microsoft hosts services in an ever-increasing number of Azure regions, enabling the infrastructure or services to be closer to your end users.

- Azure Virtual Desktop provides the rich Windows 10 experience that users expect, at multi-session cost. Azure Virtual Desktop enables the scale of Windows Server with Remote Desktop Services combined with the user experience of Windows 10, without the compromise of application compatibility. Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session runs only on Azure Virtual Desktop.

- There is no requirement for client access licenses with Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, as Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session does not require a client access license (CAL).

- In Azure Virtual Desktop, if you deploy Windows Server (Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016 or 2019), there is no requirement to purchase a Windows Server license.

- All Azure Virtual Desktop virtual machines are charged at the base compute rate. Azure Virtual Desktop is entitled through another license that you probably already own (Microsoft 365 E3+), that includes a Windows license.

- All Windows 7 virtual machines in Azure Virtual Desktop receive free extended security updates until January 14, 2023.
