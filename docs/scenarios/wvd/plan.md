# Windows Virtual Desktop planning

Windows Virtual Desktop and deployment scenarios follow the same Migrate methodology as other migration efforts. This consistent approach allows migration factories or existing migration teams to adopt the process with little change to non-technical requirements.

## Plan your migration

As they do for other migrations, the team will assess workloads, deploy them, and then release them to end users. However, Windows Virtual Desktop includes specific requirements that will necessitate a review of the Azure landing zones during the assessment of the workloads. The process will also require a proof of concept prior to the first deployment.

To build your plan, see the [cloud adoption plan DevOps template](../../plan/template.md) for an existing migration backlog in Azure DevOps. Use the template to create a detailed plan of activities.

## Next steps

For guidance on specific elements of the cloud adoption journey, see:
