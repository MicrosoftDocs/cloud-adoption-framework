# AI architecture guidance to build AI workloads on Azure

This article offers architecture guidance for organizations running AI workloads on Azure. It focuses on Azure AI platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, including Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure AI Services. It covers both generative and nongenerative AI workloads.

The Azure Architecture Center offers reference architectures and guides to help organizations build AI workloads efficiently and securely. These resources provide well-tested, structured frameworks for AI workload deployment. In [AI Ready](../ready.md#establish-ai-governance), you established a resource hierarchy that categorizes AI workloads into internal and internet-facing groups. Deploy AI workloads to subscriptions under the appropriate management groups (internal vs. internet-facing). The following tables list articles for building AI workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Azure landing zones, begin with the ***[Baseline Azure OpenAI architecture in Azure landing zone](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone)*** and deploy it to an application landing zone subscription.

## Use the AI design areas as a framework

The AI design areas provide technology-specific framework to design AI workloads with Azure's AI platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions. It focuses on Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure AI Services. Use them to establish standards and best practices related to these services:

- [Resource selection](./resource-selection.md)
- [Networking](./networking.md)
- [Governance](./governance.md)
- [Management](./management.md)
- [Security](./security.md)

Each design area includes recommendations for both generative and nongenerative AI workloads on Azure, consolidating best practices that apply to all AI workloads using Azure PaaS AI platforms.
