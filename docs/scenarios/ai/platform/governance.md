# Governance recommendations for AI workloads on Azure

This article offers governance recommendations for organizations running AI workloads on Azure. It focuses on Azure AI platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, including Azure AI Studio, Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure AI Services. It covers both generative and nongenerative AI workloads.

Effective governance supports the responsible use of AI. It enables businesses to optimize their AI investments while reducing risks associated with security, cost, and regulatory compliance.

## Govern AI models

AI model governance refers to the processes for managing AI models to ensure they produce reliable, safe, and ethical outputs. Controls over model inputs and outputs help mitigate risks. These risks include harmful content and unintended AI use. Both could affect users and the organization. These processes support responsible AI deployment, and they safeguard against potential legal and ethical challenges.

- *Establish a process to detect AI risks.* Use tools like Defender for Cloud to [discover generative AI workloads](/azure/defender-for-cloud/identify-ai-workload-model) and [explore risks](/azure/defender-for-cloud/explore-ai-risk) to predeployment generative AI artifacts. Establish a policy to regularly [red team generative AI models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming). Document identified risks and continuously update your AI governance policies to mitigate emerging issues.

- *Define baseline content filters for generative AI models.* Use [Azure AI Content Safety](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) to define a baseline content filter for your approved AI models. This safety system runs both the prompt and completion for your model through a group of classification models. These classification models detect and help prevent the output of harmful content across a range of categories. Content Safety provides features like prompt shields, groundedness detection, and protected material text detection. It scans images and text. Create a process for application teams to communicate different governance needs.

- *Ground generative AI models.* Use [system messages](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/system-message) and the [retrieval augmented generation](/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) pattern to govern the output of generative AI models. Test the effectiveness of grounding by using tools like [prompt flow](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow) or the open-source red teaming framework [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT).

## Govern AI costs

AI cost governance involves managing expenses associated with AI workloads to maximize efficiency and reduce unnecessary spending. Effective cost control ensures that AI investments align with business objectives, which prevents unforeseen costs from over-provisioning or underutilization. These practices enable organizations to optimize their AI operations financially.

- *Use the right billing model.* If you have predictable workloads, use AI commitment tiers in Azure AI services. For Azure OpenAI models, use [provisioned throughput units](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/provisioned-throughput) (PTUs), which can be less expensive than pay-as-you-go (consumption-based) pricing. It's common combine PTU endpoints and a consumption-based endpoints for cost optimization. Use PTUs on the AI model primary endpoint and a secondary, consumption-based AI endpoint for spillover. For more information, see [Introduce a gateway for multiple Azure OpenAI instances](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/azure-openai-gateway-multi-backend#multiple-azure-openai-instances-in-a-single-region-and-single-subscription).

- *Choose the right model for your use case.* Select the AI model that meets your needs without incurring excessive costs. Use less expensive models unless the use case demands a more expensive model. For fine-tuning, maximize time usage within each billing period to avoid extra charges. For more information, see [Azure OpenAI models](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) and [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/). Also see [Azure AI Studio model catalog](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) and [billing information](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview#billing) for model deployments.

- *Set provisioning limits.* Allocate provisioning quotas for each model based on expected workloads to prevent unnecessary costs. Continuously monitor dynamic quotas to ensure that they match actual demand and adjust them accordingly to maintain optimal throughput without overspending.

- *Use the right deployment type.* Azure OpenAI models allow you to use different [deployment types](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/deployment-types). Global deployment offers lower cost-per-token pricing on certain OpenAI models.

- *Evaluate hosting options.* Choose the right hosting infrastructure, depending on your solution's needs. For example, for generative AI workloads, options include managed online endpoints, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure App Service, each with its own billing model. Select the option that provides the best balance between performance and cost for your specific requirements.

- *Control client behavior in consumption-based services.* Limit client access to your AI service by enforcing security protocols like network controls, keys, and role-based access control (RBAC). Ensure that clients use API constraints like max tokens and max completions. When possible, batch requests to optimize efficiency. Keep prompts concise, but provide necessary context to reduce token consumption.

- *Consider using a generative AI gateway.* A [generative AI gateway](/azure/api-management/genai-gateway-capabilities) allows you to track token usage, throttle token usage, apply circuit breakers, and route to different AI endpoints to control costs.

- *Create a policy to shut down compute instances.* Define and enforce a policy stating that AI resources must use the automatic shutdown feature on virtual machines and compute instances in Azure AI Studio and Azure Machine Learning. Automatic shutdown is applicable to nonproduction environments and production workloads that you can take offline for certain periods of time.

For more cost management guidance, see [Manage AI costs](../manage.md#manage-ai-costs) and [cost optimization](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat#cost-optimization) in the Azure OpenAI baseline architecture.

## Govern AI platforms

AI platform governance includes applying policy controls to various AI services on Azure, such as Azure AI Studio and Azure Machine Learning. Using platform-level governance enforces consistent security, compliance, and operational policies across the AI ecosystem. This alignment supports effective oversight, which strengthens overall AI management and reliability.

- *Use built-in governance policies.* Use Azure Policy to apply built-in policy definitions for each AI platform you're using. It includes [Azure AI Studio](/azure/ai-services/policy-reference?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/policy-reference), [Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/policy-reference), [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/policy-reference), and others.

- *Enable Azure landing zone AI policies.* For Azure landing zone users, the [deployment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/implementation-options#environment-development-approaches) includes a curated set of recommended built-in policies for Azure AI platform services. Select the policy initiative you want to use under the *Workload Specific Compliance* category during an Azure landing zone deployment. The policies sets include [Azure OpenAI](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-OpenAI.html), [Azure Machine Learning](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-MachineLearning.html), and [Azure AI Search](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-CognitiveServices.html), and [Azure Bot services](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-BotService.html).

## Govern AI security

AI security governance addresses the need to protect AI workloads from threats that could compromise data, models, or infrastructure. Robust security practices safeguard these systems against unauthorized access and data breaches. This protection ensures the integrity and reliability of AI solutions, which is essential for maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance.

- *Enable Defender for Cloud on every subscription.* Defender for Cloud provides a cost-effective approach for detecting configurations in your deployed resources that aren't secure. You should also enable [AI threat protection](/azure/defender-for-cloud/ai-threat-protection).

- *Configure access control.* Grant least privilege user access to centralized AI resources. For example, start with the Reader Azure role, and elevate to the Contributor Azure role if the limited permissions slow down application development.

- *Use managed identities.* Use [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) on all supported Azure services. Grant least privilege access to application resources that need to access AI model endpoints.

- *Use just-in-time access.* Use [privileged identity management (PIM)](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) for just-in-time access.

## Govern AI operations

AI operations governance focuses on managing and maintaining stable AI services. These operations support long-term reliability and performance. Centralized oversight and continuity plans help organizations avoid downtime, which ensures the consistent business value of AI. These efforts contribute to efficient AI deployment and sustained operational effectiveness.

- *Review and manage AI models.* Develop a policy for managing model versioning, especially as models are upgraded or retired. You need to maintain compatibility with existing systems and ensure a smooth transition between model versions.

- *Define a business continuity and disaster recovery plan.* Establish a policy for business continuity and disaster recovery for your AI endpoints and AI data. Configure baseline disaster recovery for resources that host your AI model endpoints. These resources include [Azure AI Studio](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/disaster-recovery), [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-high-availability-machine-learning), [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/business-continuity-disaster-recovery), or Azure AI services. All Azure data stores, such as [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance), [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore), and [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/accelerated-database-recovery), provide reliability and disaster recovery guidance that you should follow.

- *Define baseline metrics for AI resources.* Enable recommended alert rules to receive notifications of deviations that indicate a decline in workload health. For examples, see [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/monitor-azure-cognitive-search#azure-ai-search-alert-rules), [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/monitor-azure-machine-learning), [Azure AI Studio prompt flow deployments](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/monitor-quality-safety?tabs=azure-studio), and guidance on individual Azure AI services.

## Govern AI regulatory compliance

Regulatory compliance in AI requires organizations to follow industry standards and legal obligations, which reduce risks related to liabilities and build trust. Compliance measures help organizations avoid penalties and improve credibility with clients and regulators. Adhering to these standards establishes a solid foundation for responsible and compliant AI usage.

- *Automate compliance.* Use [Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager](/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-manager-overview) to assess and manage compliance across cloud environments. Use the applicable [regulatory compliance initiatives](/azure/governance/policy/samples/#regulatory-compliance) in Azure Policy for your industry. Apply other policies based on the AI services that you use, such as [Azure AI Studio](/azure/ai-services/security-controls-policy) and [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/policy-reference).

- *Develop industry-specific compliance checklists.* Regulations and standards differ by industry and location. You need to know your regulatory requirements and compile checklists that reflect the regulatory demands that are relevant to your industry. Use standards, such as ISO/IEC 23053:2022 (Framework for Artificial Intelligence Systems Using Machine Learning), to audit policies that are applied to your AI workloads.

## Govern AI data

AI data governance involves policies for ensuring that data feeding into AI models is appropriate, compliant, and secure. Data governance protects privacy and intellectual property, which enhances AI outputs' reliability and quality. These measures help mitigate risks related to data misuse, and they align with regulatory and ethical standards.

- *Establish a process for cataloging data.* Use a tool like [Microsoft Purview](/purview/what-is-data-catalog) to implement a unified data catalog and classification system across your organization. Integrate these policies into your CI/CD pipelines for AI development.

- *Maintain data security boundaries.* Cataloging data helps ensure that you don't feed sensitive data into public-facing AI endpoints. When you create indexes from certain data sources, the indexing process can remove the security boundaries around data. Ensure that any data ingested into AI models is classified and vetted according to centralized standards.

- *Prevent copyright infringement.* Use a content filtering system like [Protected material detection in Azure AI Content Safety](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/protected-material) to filter out copyrighted material. If you're grounding, training, or fine-tuning an AI model, ensure that you use legally obtained and properly licensed data and implement safeguards to prevent the model from infringing on copyrights. Regularly review outputs for intellectual property compliance.

- *Implement version control for grounding data.* Establish a version control process for grounding data, for example, in RAG. Versioning ensures that you can track any changes to the underlying data or its structure. You can revert the changes if necessary, helping maintain consistency across deployments.
