## Acquire AI skills

Start by assessing your current talent pool, then decide whether to upskill existing staff, recruit new talent, or engage external experts. A skilled team helps you manage AI projects, adapt to change, and drive innovation. Because AI evolves rapidly, foster a culture of continuous learning.

- *Learn AI skills.* Use the [AI learning hub](/ai/) platform for free AI training, certifications, and product guidance. For Azure, set certification goals, such as [Azure AI Fundamentals](/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/), [Azure AI Engineer Associate](/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/), and [Azure Data Scientist Associate](/credentials/certifications/azure-data-scientist/) certifications.

- *Recruit AI professionals.* Hire experts in model development, generative AI, or AI ethics to fill gaps beyond internal capacity. Update job descriptions to reflect evolving skill needs. Build an employer brand that emphasizes innovation and technical leadership. Partner with universities to access emerging talent.

- *Use Microsoft partners to acquire AI skills.* Use the [Microsoft partners marketplace](https://partner.microsoft.com//partnership/find-a-partner) to access AI, data, and Azure expertise. Partners can fill skill gaps quickly and support projects across industries.

## Access AI resources

Use the following guidance to quickly understand access requirements for Copilot and Azure AI offerings:

- *Access Microsoft 365 Copilot.* Most Microsoft SaaS Copilots require a license or an add-on subscription. [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com//microsoft-365/microsoft-copilot#plans) requires a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise license to which you add on the Copilot license.

- *Access Microsoft Copilot Studio.* [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-licensing-subscriptions) uses a standalone license or an add-on license.

- *Access in-product Copilots.* In-product Copilots have different access requirements for each, but access to the primary product is required. For more information on each, see [GitHub](https://azure.microsoft.com//products/github/copilot), [Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com//power-platform/products/power-apps), [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com//power-platform/products/power-bi), [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com//dynamics-365/solutions/ai), [Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com//power-platform/products/power-automate), [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/fundamentals/copilot-enable-fabric), and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com//products/copilot/).

- *Access role-based Copilots.* Role-based Copilots also have their own access requirements. For more information, see [Role-based agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-work#role-based-agents) and [Microsoft Copilot for Security](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-copilot-security).

- *Access Azure services.* Azure PaaS and IaaS solutions require an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search). These services include Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI services, Azure Virtual Machines, and Azure CycleCloud.

## Prioritize AI use cases

Prioritize the use cases defined in your [AI Strategy](./strategy.md#identify-ai-use-cases). Focus on projects that provide the most value, align with business goals, and match your current capabilities.

1. *Assess skills and resources*. Review your AI maturity, data availability, tools, and staffing. Use this input to reset priorities based on what's achievable.

1. *Evaluate use cases.* Rank each use case based on feasibility and strategic value. Confirm alignment with organizational goals.

1. *Select top use cases.* Create a shortlist of high-priority use cases.

## Create an AI proof of concept

If you plan to build an AI agent or workload, create a proof of concept (PoC) to validate feasibility and value. The PoC or trial helps prioritize use cases, reduce risk, and uncover challenges before scaling.

1. *Choose the right use case.* Select a high-value project from your AI shortlist that matches your AI maturity. If you're building an AI app, start with an internal, non-customer-facing project to limit risk and test your approach. Use A/B testing to validate the solution and gather baseline data.

1. *Get started.* Microsoft has step-by-step guidance for POCs on its various AI services. Use the following table to find the right get started guide.

    | AI type  | Get started guide |
    |----------|-------------------|
    | Generative AI | Azure PaaS: [Azure AI Foundry](/azure/ai-studio/quickstarts/get-started-playground) and [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/assistants-quickstart)<br><br>Microsoft Copilots: [Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-get-started) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/decision-guide)   |
    | Machine learning | [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day)         |
    | Analytical AI | Azure AI services: [Azure AI Content Safety](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-jailbreak), [Azure AI Custom Vision](/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier), [Document Intelligence Studio](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/quickstarts/try-document-intelligence-studio), [Face service](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/identity-client-library), [Azure AI Language](/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview#available-features), [Azure AI Speech](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/overview#get-started), [Azure AI Translator](/azure/ai-services/translator/translator-overview#translator-features-and-development-options), [Azure AI Vision](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview#get-started)<br>*Each feature of this AI service has its own guide.* |

1. *Reprioritize based on results.* Use the PoC to reprioritize your use cases. If the POC reveals major challenges, shift to more practical opportunities.

## Implement responsible AI

Build responsible AI into your implementation plan from the start. Apply ethical principles, follow regulatory standards, and create governance practices that ensure your AI systems align with organizational values, protect user rights, and meet compliance requirements.

1. *Use responsible AI planning tools.* Use the following table to find responsible AI tools and frameworks.

    | Responsible AI planning tool | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | [AI impact assessment template](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices)| Evaluate the social, economic, and ethical effects of AI initiatives.|
    | [Human-AI eXperience Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/hax-toolkit/) | Design AI systems that support user well-being and positive interaction. |
    | [Responsible AI Maturity Model](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/) | Assess and advance your organization’s responsible AI maturity.|
    | [Responsible AI for workload teams](/azure/well-architected/ai/responsible-ai) | Follow practical guidance for applying responsible AI in Azure workloads. |

1. *Start AI governance.* Establish governance to guide AI projects and monitor system behavior. Identify AI-related risks, then define policies covering roles, compliance, and ethical requirements. See [Govern AI](./govern.md) for details.

1. *Start AI management.* Use AI operations frameworks like GenAIOps or MLOps. These frameworks include deployment tracking, performance monitoring, and cost control. See [Manage AI](./manage.md) for details.

1. *Start AI security.* Protect AI systems with regular security assessments. Address threats such as adversarial inputs and data breaches. See [Secure AI](./secure.md) for details.

## Estimate delivery timelines

Assign a delivery timeline to each AI opportunity based on insights from your PoC. Microsoft Copilots provide the shortest timelines for seeing a return on investment (days to weeks). Timelines for building AI workloads with Azure vary by use case and your AI maturity level. Most build projects require several weeks to months to reach production readiness.

## Next step

To build AI workloads with Azure, proceed to [AI Ready](./ready.md). For Copilot adoption, skip to the [Govern AI](./govern.md) to establish organizational AI  governance.
