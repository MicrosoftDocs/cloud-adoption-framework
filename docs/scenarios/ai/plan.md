# Plan for AI adoption

This article helps you create an AI adoption plan that transforms your organization's AI strategy into actionable steps. An AI adoption plan bridges the gap between AI vision and execution. The plan ensures alignment between AI initiatives and business goals while addressing skill gaps, resource requirements, and implementation timelines.

## Assess AI skills

Current capability assessment prevents resource misallocation and ensures realistic project planning aligned with organizational readiness. AI projects fail when organizations attempt implementations beyond their technical maturity or data availability. You must evaluate your skills, data assets, and infrastructure to establish a foundation for successful AI adoption. Here's how:

1. **Measure your AI maturity level using the skills and data readiness framework.** The framework provides objective criteria to assess your organization's current AI capabilities. This measurement prevents overcommitting to projects beyond your current capabilities. Use the following table to assess your maturity:

2. **Inventory your data assets and evaluate their quality for AI use cases.** Data quality directly impacts AI model performance and determines which use cases you can implement successfully. This inventory reveals data preparation requirements and helps prioritize use cases based on available data. Document data sources, formats, quality, and accessibility across your organization.

3. **Review your technology infrastructure and determine AI readiness requirements.** Infrastructure capacity constrains AI project scope and influences deployment strategies. This review helps you plan infrastructure investments and select appropriate Azure services. Assess compute resources, storage capacity, network bandwidth, and security controls needed for your target AI use cases.

## Acquire AI skills

A comprehensive capability-building strategy ensures your organization has the skills needed to implement and maintain AI systems successfully. Skills gaps create project delays and increase the risk of implementation failures. You must develop a multi-faceted approach that combines training, hiring, and partnerships to build sustainable AI capabilities. Here's how:

1. **Develop internal AI skills through structured learning programs.** Internal skill development provides long-term capability building and ensures knowledge retention within your organization.

## Prioritize AI use cases

Strategic prioritization ensures you focus resources on projects that deliver maximum value while matching your organizational capabilities. Use case prioritization reduces implementation risk and accelerates time to value. You must evaluate each use case against feasibility, strategic value, and resource requirements to create an achievable implementation roadmap. Here's how:

1. **Evaluate use cases against your current AI maturity and available resources.** Realistic evaluation prevents overcommitting to projects beyond your current capabilities and ensures successful implementation. This assessment helps you focus on achievable goals that build momentum for future projects. Review your AI maturity level, data availability, technical infrastructure, and staffing capacity for each use case defined in your [AI Strategy](./strategy.md#identify-ai-use-cases).

2. **Rank use cases by strategic value and implementation feasibility.** Strategic ranking helps you allocate limited resources to projects with the highest potential impact and success probability. This approach maximizes return on AI investments while building organizational confidence. Score each use case on business impact, technical complexity, resource requirements, and alignment with organizational goals.

3. **Create a prioritized implementation roadmap with clear success criteria.** A structured roadmap provides clear direction for implementation teams and enables progress tracking against defined milestones. This roadmap helps manage stakeholder expectations and resource allocation. Select top-priority use cases and define specific success metrics, timelines, and resource requirements for each project.

## Validate concepts through proof of concepts

Proof of concepts reduce implementation risk by validating technical feasibility and business value before full-scale development. PoCs help identify potential challenges and refine requirements in a controlled environment. You must create focused validation projects that test core assumptions and gather data for informed decision-making. Here's how:

1. **Select an appropriate use case for proof of concept validation.** The right PoC selection balances learning opportunities with manageable risk and complexity. This selection ensures you gather meaningful insights without overwhelming your team or organization. Choose a high-value project from your prioritized list that matches your AI maturity level. Start with internal, non-customer-facing projects to limit risk and test your approach.

2. **Implement a focused proof of concept using Microsoft guidance and tools.** Structured implementation reduces development time and ensures you follow proven practices for your chosen AI approach. This approach maximizes learning while minimizing resource investment. Use the following implementation guides based on your AI type:

   | Machine learning | [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day) |
   | Analytical AI | Azure AI services with specific guides for [Content Safety](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-jailbreak), [Custom Vision](/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier), [Document Intelligence](/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/quickstarts/try-document-intelligence-studio), and other services |

3. **Use PoC results to refine your use case prioritization and implementation approach.** PoC insights reveal practical challenges and opportunities that inform future project planning and resource allocation. This feedback loop ensures your AI roadmap remains realistic and achievable. Document lessons learned, technical challenges, and business value demonstrated. Adjust your use case priorities based on proven feasibility and measured impact.

## Establish responsible AI practices

Responsible AI practices protect your organization from ethical, legal, and reputational risks while ensuring AI systems align with organizational values. Early integration of responsible AI principles prevents costly redesigns and builds stakeholder trust. You must embed ethical considerations, governance frameworks, and security measures into your implementation plan from the beginning. Here's how:

1. **Use responsible AI planning tools to evaluate potential impacts and design ethical systems.** Systematic evaluation tools help identify potential risks and ensure AI systems meet ethical standards and regulatory requirements. These tools provide structured approaches to complex ethical considerations. Use the [AI impact assessment template](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices), [Human-AI eXperience Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/hax-toolkit/), and [Responsible AI Maturity Model](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/) to guide your planning process.

2. **Implement AI governance frameworks to guide project decisions and monitor system behavior.** Governance frameworks provide consistent decision-making criteria and ensure accountability across AI projects. These frameworks help organizations maintain control over AI development and deployment. Establish policies covering roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and ethical standards. See [Govern AI](./govern.md) for detailed guidance on governance implementation.

3. **Apply AI security and operations best practices throughout the implementation lifecycle.** Security and operational excellence ensure AI systems remain reliable, secure, and cost-effective throughout their lifecycle. These practices prevent security incidents and operational failures. Implement AI operations frameworks like GenAIOps or MLOps for deployment tracking and performance monitoring. See [Manage AI](./manage.md) and [Secure AI](./secure.md) for detailed implementation guidance.

## Estimate delivery timelines

Realistic timeline estimation enables effective resource planning and stakeholder management while ensuring project success. Timeline accuracy depends on project complexity, organizational maturity, and resource availability. You must base timeline estimates on empirical data from your proof of concepts and organizational capabilities. Here's how:

1. **Use proof of concept results to estimate implementation timelines for each use case.** PoC data provides realistic baseline estimates that account for your organization's specific capabilities and constraints. This approach produces more accurate timelines than theoretical estimates. Document development time, testing cycles, and deployment complexity observed during PoC implementation.

2. **Account for organizational maturity and complexity factors in timeline planning.** Different AI solutions have characteristic implementation timelines that vary based on organizational readiness and project scope. This understanding helps set appropriate expectations with stakeholders. Microsoft Copilots typically provide the shortest timelines for return on investment (days to weeks), while custom Azure AI workloads require several weeks to months to reach production readiness.

3. **Build in buffer time for learning, iteration, and unexpected challenges.** AI projects often encounter unforeseen technical challenges and require multiple iterations to achieve desired outcomes. Buffer time prevents schedule pressure that could compromise quality or ethical considerations. Add 20-30% contingency time to initial estimates and plan for multiple development cycles.
