## Identify AI use cases

AI enhances individual efficiency and improves business processes. Generative AI fosters productivity and enhances customer experiences. Nongenerative AI, such as machine learning, is ideal for analyzing structured data and automating repetitive tasks. With this understanding, identify areas across your business where AI could add value. For more information, see [generative AI use cases](#generative-ai-use-cases) and [nongenerative AI use cases](#nongenerative-ai-use-cases).

- *Look for automation opportunities.* Identify processes suitable for automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Focus on repetitive tasks, data-heavy operations, or areas with high error rates where AI can have a significant effect.

- *Gather customer feedback.* Use customer feedback to uncover use cases that would have an impact on customer satisfaction when automated with AI.

- *Conduct an internal assessment.* Gather input from various departments to identify challenges and inefficiencies that AI could address. Document workflows and gather input from stakeholders to uncover opportunities for automation, insight generation, or improved decision-making.

- *Explore industry use cases.* Research how similar organizations or industries use AI to solve problems or enhance operations. Use tools like the [AI architectures](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/) in the Azure Architecture Center for inspiration and to evaluate which approaches might suit your needs.

- *Set AI targets.* For each identified use case, clearly define the goal (general purpose), objective (desired outcome), and success metric (quantifiable measure). These elements will serve as benchmarks to guide your AI adoption and measure its impact. For more information, see [example AI strategy](#example-ai-strategy).

## Define an AI technology strategy

Select AI technologies that align closely with your organization's skills, available data, and budget. Microsoft offers software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). These services provide different levels of customization and [shared responsibility](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai). To guide your decision, use the following AI decision tree and guidance.

## Define an AI data strategy

Create a data strategy tailored to your AI use cases. Identify acceptable data sources, workload types (internal vs. external), and implement guidelines ensuring the responsible use of AI. Follow these steps:

- *Establish data governance.* Restrict internet-facing ("Online") workloads to public data only. Allow internal ("Corporate") workloads to utilize business data while maintaining defined data access boundaries. Use [Microsoft Purview](/purview/data-governance-overview) to govern data. Reference the [Data management landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/data-management-landing-zone) for architecture guidance.

- *Prepare for data scalability.* Anticipate the volume, velocity, and variety of data required. Choose flexible architectures capable of scaling according to demand. For an architecture, see [Data landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/data-landing-zone).

- *Plan the data lifecycle.* Develop clear guidelines for managing data throughout its lifecycle:

  - *Data collection:* Identify data sources such as databases, APIs, IoT devices, third-party data, or Azure Data Factory for ingestion. Maintain [data lineage](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/govern-lineage) with [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/governance/lineage) or [Microsoft Purview](/purview/concept-data-lineage).
  
  - *Data storage:* Recommend storage solutions aligned with data type and scale, including structured, unstructured, and real-time scenarios.
  
  - *Data processing:* Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT pipelines to ensure data quality and readiness. Utilize tools like [One Lake shortcuts](/fabric/onelake/onelake-shortcuts) or [Mirroring](/fabric/database/mirrored-database/overview) in Microsoft Fabric.
  
  - - *Data auditing.* Implement regular audits to identify and mitigate bias within AI datasets. Use tools in the [Responsible AI Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox#introducing-responsible-ai-dashboard) to analyze and audit data and model outputs.

## Define a responsible AI strategy

Understand your responsibilities in ensuring AI solutions remain trustworthy, ethical, and beneficial to all users. Responsibilities differ based on the specific AI technologies you use.

- *Establish AI accountability.* Assign a dedicated individual or team to monitor, manage, and respond to changes in AI technology and regulatory requirements.

- *Use responsible AI principles.* Adopt Microsoft's six [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai#advancing-aI-policy) principles, which align with the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf). Use these principles as business objectives.

- *Identify responsible AI tools.* Select and apply appropriate Responsible AI [tools and processes](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices#tabs-pill-bar-oc8dad_tab1) are relevant. These tools help ensure your AI initiatives align with responsible AI standards.

- *Understand compliance.* Legal and regulatory obligations shape AI project implementation. Identify, understand, and comply with relevant local and international AI regulations and legal standards that apply to your operations.
