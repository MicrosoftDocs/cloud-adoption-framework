## Identify AI use cases

AI supports two main goals: enhancing individual efficiency and improving business processes. Generative AI fosters productivity and enhances customer experiences, while nongenerative AI, such as machine learning, is ideal for analyzing structured data and automating repetitive tasks. With this understanding, identify areas across your business where AI could add value. For more information, see [example AI use cases](#example-ai-use-cases).

- *Look for automation opportunities.* Identify processes suitable for automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Focus on repetitive tasks, data-heavy operations, or areas with high error rates where AI can have a significant effect.

- *Conduct an assessment.* Gather input from various departments to identify challenges and inefficiencies that AI could address. Document current workflows to find areas where AI can automate tasks or provide insights.

- *Explore industry use cases.* Use the [AI architectures](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/) in the Azure Architecture Center for insights on problems AI can solve. Research how other businesses use AI. Stay informed about emerging AI technologies and applications relevant to your industry.

- *Set AI targets.* For each use case, define a goal (general purpose), objective (desired outcome), and success metric (quantifiable measure) to guide your AI adoption. Clear AI targets drive you toward the right AI solution and help you measure and achieve value faster.

 For more information, see [example AI strategy](#example-ai-strategy).

## Define an AI technology strategy

An AI technology strategy involves selecting the right tools and platforms for your generative and nongenerative AI use cases. You need to pick AI solutions that align with your skill set, data readiness, and budget. Microsoft has various AI solutions to align with different needs. There are software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) options. The service model you choose affects the [AI shared responsibility](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai) between you and Microsoft.

Use the following AI decision tree to narrow down options for each AI use case. Review all the options before making your initial decision. When you identify an AI service, confirm that the service is a good fit. Use the following guidance to validate the skills needed, data needed, and cost factors to ensure success.

## Define an AI data strategy

For each AI use case, you should define an AI data strategy that outlines data collection, storage, and usage practices aligning with regulatory, ethical, and operational standards. Tailoring the strategy to each specific use case ensures reliable AI outputs and promotes data security and privacy. If needed, you can consolidate these individual strategies into a broader summary data strategy for your organization.

- *Establish data governance.* Define data governance principles specific to the AI use case to ensure workloads are transparent, accountable, and compliant with legal and ethical standards. Include categorization of data based on sensitivity and policies to control access, usage, and storage relevant to the use case.

- *Plan the data lifecycle.* Specify how you collect, store, process, and retire data for this particular AI use case. Include retention and disposal policies, and use version control to maintain accuracy during updates.

- *Set up AI fairness and bias controls.* Develop processes to detect and address bias in the data used for this AI use case. Use tools like Fairlearn to ensure models provide fair and equitable outcomes, especially when working with sensitive data attributes.

- *Promote collaboration between AI and data teams.* Align AI development with data engineering efforts to ensure models are built using high-quality, well-managed data. Establish a unified pipeline for AI model training and data updates.

- *Prepare for data scalability.* Forecast the volume, velocity, and variety of data needed for this AI workload. Use flexible architectures to scale with demand and consider cloud-based infrastructures for efficient resource management.

- *Incorporate data management automation.* Plan to use AI and machine learning to automate tasks like tagging, cataloging, and data quality checks. Automation improves accuracy and allows teams to focus on strategic efforts.

- *Plan for continuous monitoring and evaluation.* Establish regular audits of data and model outputs to ensure ongoing data quality, performance, and fairness. Monitor AI models and data pipelines to identify any shifts that might impact reliability or compliance.

 For more information, see [example AI strategy](#example-ai-strategy).

## Define a responsible AI strategy

For each AI use case, you should define a responsible AI strategy that outlines your role in ensuring AI solutions remain trustworthy and beneficial for all users. Responsibilities might vary depending on the technology adopted in each case. If necessary, create a broader summary responsible AI strategy that encompasses overarching principles derived from individual use cases.

- *Establish AI accountability.* As AI technology and regulations advance, assign someone to monitor and govern these changes. It's typically a responsibility of the [AI CoE](./center-of-excellence.md) or an AI lead.

- *Align with established responsible AI principles.* Microsoft follows six [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai#advancing-aI-policy) principles that adhere to the [NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf). Use these principles as business goals to define success and govern your AI adoption in each use case.

- *Identify responsible AI tools.* Responsible AI tools ensure that your AI aligns with broader responsible AI practices. As part of your strategy, identify which Responsible AI [tools and processes](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices#tabs-pill-bar-oc8dad_tab1) are relevant.

- *Understand legal and regulatory compliance requirements.* Legal and regulatory compliance influence how you build and manage AI workloads. Research and adhere to the requirements governing AI where you operate.
