## Identify AI use cases

AI improves individual efficiency and enhances business processes. Generative AI increases productivity and improves customer experiences. Nongenerative AI, such as machine learning, analyzes structured data and automates repetitive tasks. Use this understanding to identify areas across your business where AI adds value.

1. **Identify automation opportunities.** Focus on processes suitable for automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Target repetitive tasks, data-heavy operations, or areas with high error rates where AI can have a significant impact.

2. **Gather customer feedback.** Use customer feedback to uncover use cases that improve customer satisfaction when automated with AI. This feedback helps prioritize impactful AI initiatives.

3. **Conduct an internal assessment.** Collect input from various departments to identify challenges and inefficiencies that AI can address. Document workflows and gather stakeholder input to uncover opportunities for automation, insight generation, or improved decision-making.

4. **Research industry use cases.** Investigate how similar organizations or industries use AI to solve problems or enhance operations. Use tools like the [AI architectures](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/) in the Azure Architecture Center for inspiration and to evaluate suitable approaches.

5. **Define AI targets.** For each identified use case, define the goal (general purpose), objective (desired outcome), and success metric (quantifiable measure). These benchmarks guide your AI adoption and measure success. For more information, see [example AI strategy](#example-ai-strategy).

## Define an AI technology strategy

Select AI technologies that align with your organization's skills, available data, and budget. Microsoft offers software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

## Develop an AI data strategy

An AI data strategy defines how your organization plans to acquire, manage, and use data to support AI initiatives while maintaining governance, scalability, and responsible practices. This strategy ensures that data assets align with AI use cases and business objectives while addressing security, compliance, and ethical considerations. You must plan data governance frameworks, assess scalability requirements, design lifecycle management approaches, and establish responsible data practices to create a comprehensive AI data strategy.

1. **Plan data governance frameworks for AI workloads.** Data governance planning establishes the foundation for secure and compliant AI data usage by defining access controls, data boundaries, and responsible use policies. This planning phase identifies governance requirements for different AI use cases and establishes frameworks for ongoing data management. Define data classification schemes based on workload exposure and sensitivity levels. Restrict internet-facing ("Online") workloads to public data only while allowing internal ("Corporate") workloads to access business data with defined boundaries. Plan to use [Microsoft Purview data classification](/purview/create-sensitivity-label) for categorizing data assets. Reference the [Data management landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/data-management-landing-zone) for governance architecture guidance.

2. **Assess data scalability requirements for AI initiatives.** Scalability assessment ensures that your data strategy can accommodate current and projected AI workload demands without performance limitations or excessive costs. This assessment identifies data volume, velocity, and variety requirements that inform technology selection and architecture planning. Document current data volumes, processing frequencies, and data types for each identified AI use case. Analyze projected growth patterns to inform scalability planning. Plan flexible storage and processing approaches that can scale with demand and accommodate both batch and real-time processing requirements. Reference the [Data landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/data-landing-zone) for scalable architecture patterns.

3. **Design data lifecycle management approaches for AI data assets.** Data lifecycle planning ensures that data remains accessible, secure, and cost-effective throughout its journey from collection to disposal while supporting AI workload requirements. This planning addresses data collection strategies, storage optimization, processing workflows, and quality assurance processes. Plan systematic data collection approaches from identified sources including databases, APIs, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and third-party data providers. Design storage strategies aligned with data characteristics and access patterns, selecting appropriate tiers based on frequency, retention requirements, and performance needs. Plan data processing workflows using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT pipelines to ensure quality and AI readiness. Establish regular auditing processes to identify to mitigate bias within AI datasets using tools like the [Responsible AI Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox#introducing-responsible-ai-dashboard).

4. **Establish responsible data practices for AI development.** Responsible data practices ensure that AI systems use data ethically and maintain compliance with organizational values and regulatory requirements. These practices guide data collection, usage, and retention decisions throughout the AI lifecycle. Plan data lineage tracking using [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/governance/lineage) or [Microsoft Purview](/purview/concept-data-lineage) to maintain transparency in data usage. Establish guidelines for data quality standards, bias detection, and fairness considerations in AI training datasets. Define data retention and disposal policies that balance AI performance requirements with privacy and regulatory compliance obligations.

## Develop a responsible AI strategy

A responsible AI strategy defines your organization's approach to ensuring AI solutions remain trustworthy, ethical, and beneficial to all users while meeting regulatory and organizational requirements. This strategy establishes the framework for ethical AI development and deployment that aligns with industry standards and business objectives. You must plan accountability structures, define responsible AI principles as business objectives, identify appropriate tools and processes, and assess compliance requirements to create a comprehensive responsible AI strategy.

1. **Plan accountability structures for AI governance and regulatory oversight.** Accountability planning establishes clear ownership and responsibility for AI governance decisions while ensuring responsive management of evolving regulatory requirements. This planning phase defines roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority for AI initiatives across the organization. Define dedicated accountability by planning to assign individuals or teams to monitor, manage, and respond to changes in AI technology and regulatory requirements. Plan clear roles and responsibilities for AI governance, including escalation procedures, decision-making authority, and regular review processes for AI initiatives. [Create an AI cloud center of excellence](./center-of-excellence.md) to take on these responsibilities.

2. **Define responsible AI principles as strategic business objectives.** Responsible AI principles provide the strategic framework for ethical AI development and deployment that guides organizational decision-making and aligns with industry standards. These principles become business objectives that shape AI project selection, development approaches, and success measurements. Plan to adopt Microsoft's six [responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai#advancing-aI-policy), which align with the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf). Define how these principles integrate into project planning methodologies, development processes, and success metrics for AI initiatives.

3. **Identify appropriate responsible AI tools and processes for your AI portfolio.** Tool identification ensures that your organization selects appropriate mechanisms for implementing ethical AI principles and maintains consistent application of responsible AI standards. This planning addresses tool selection criteria, integration approaches, and operational processes for responsible AI practices. Assess and plan to select appropriate Responsible AI [tools and processes](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/tools-practices#tabs-pill-bar-oc8dad_tab1) that align with your planned AI use cases and organizational risk profiles. Plan integration approaches for these tools within development workflows and operational procedures to ensure consistent application across AI initiatives.

4. **Assess compliance requirements for AI regulations and legal standards.** Compliance assessment protects the organization from legal risks and ensures that AI initiatives align with applicable laws and industry standards while informing strategic planning decisions. Compliance requirements vary by industry, geography, and AI application, requiring comprehensive analysis and strategic planning. Identify and assess relevant local and international AI regulations that apply to your planned operations and AI use cases. Plan processes for monitoring regulatory changes, updating compliance strategies, and ensuring ongoing alignment with legal requirements throughout your AI adoption journey.
