# Establish an AI Center of Excellence

This article provides guidance for establishing and an AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE). An AI CoE is an internal team of various experts that focuses on AI success within an organization. As you initiate different AI adoption projects, an AI CoE provides standardization and oversight across the organization. For smaller organizations or organizations at the early stages of AI adoption, the AI CoE drives the overall adoption of AI and ensures it delivers its intended value. As you mature in the cloud and with AI, a platform team implements AI governance and the AI CoE provides these functions.

The group helps avoid challenges related to incorporating AI into your business processes and roles. It helps prevent fractured and ungoverned AI adoption. An AI CoE establishes the AI adoption foundation and consults both business and technical AI adoption.

## Determine its role

Align the AI CoE with existing capabilities. The AI CoE's level of influence depends on your cloud operating model. If a Cloud Center of Excellence exists, extend it by adding AI expertise to this group. Only create a standalone AI CoE only if existing structures lack capacity or expose critical risks.

## Appoint an AI CoE leader

Select an accountable leader responsible for driving AI initiatives. Clear leadership ensures accountability and strategic alignment. Identify candidates with strong AI expertise and leadership qualities.

## Define AI CoE responsibilities

- *Business strategy:* 
    - Identify business goals that AI can support
