# Network topology and connectivity for Oracle Database@Azure - Migration connectivity design

Preparing for a successful Oracle Exadata Database@Azure migration often requires that you establish secure, high-bandwidth connectivity between your current source environment and Azure. This article describes foundational networking connectivity strategies for migration. For more information about comprehensive migration steps and methodologies, see [Migrate Oracle workloads to Azure](./oracle-migration-planning.md).

The following diagram shows the connectivity between Oracle Exadata Database@Azure and an on-premises network. You can also connect Oracle Exadata Database@Azure to other source sites.

> [!NOTE]
> Because of connectivity limitations from Oracle Exadata Database@Azure to private endpoints, connectivity to a private endpoint requires an intermediate hop through a routing device such as a network virtual appliance (NVA). This appliance can be a hub NVA such as an Azure firewall or non-Microsoft NVA. For nonproduction environments, a dedicated [virtual machine can be used for IP address forwarding](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/fasttrackforazureblog/creating-a-local-network-virtual-appliance-in-azure-for-oracle-databaseazure/4218101).

The following diagram shows connectivity to Azure NetApp Files and other sources. This configuration doesn't require an intermediate hop for connectivity.

## Design considerations

- **High throughput requirements:** Migrations often require large data transfers. Ensure that network paths support sustained high throughput.

- **Connectivity options:** Both Azure ExpressRoute and VPN tunnels can be used to connect on-premises environments to Oracle Exadata Database@Azure. ExpressRoute provides more predictable performance and lower latency.

- **Shared connectivity effects:** If the same ExpressRoute or VPN connection is used by multiple services, ensure that increased migration traffic doesn't negatively affect their performance.

## Design recommendations

- **Prefer ExpressRoute over VPN:** For on-premises to Oracle Exadata Database@Azure connectivity, we recommend ExpressRoute because of its dedicated bandwidth, predictable performance, lower latency, and higher levels of security.

- **Capacity planning:** Confirm that your chosen ExpressRoute circuit has sufficient bandwidth headroom for the migration phase. Ensure that your choice doesn't affect other workloads. If necessary, use bandwidth limiting.

## Next step

After you plan and establish your network connectivity, proceed to [Migrate Oracle workloads to Azure](./oracle-migration-planning.md) to begin or refine your migration strategy.
