# Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure business continuity and disaster recovery guide

This article describes business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategies for Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure. Organizations that use Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure achieve enterprise-grade high availability through automated management capabilities and proven disaster recovery solutions.

In this article, you learn how to do the following tasks:

 - Implement BCDR solutions that meet your recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) requirements.
 - Configure automated failover capabilities.
 - Establish backup strategies for Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure.

## Set availability requirements for Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure

Organizations must establish clear recovery objectives before they implement BCDR solutions for Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure. RTO represents the maximum acceptable downtime after a failure. RPO defines the maximum acceptable data loss. These critical metrics determine the appropriate BCDR architecture and Oracle technologies for your cloud database environment.

- **Define your recovery objectives based on business requirements.** Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure supports different availability levels that align with [Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) principles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/haovw/oracle-maximum-availability-architecture-and-oracle-autonomous-database.html#GUID-80E31978-A2B5-4106-9CB8-C8DFD8AA9637). The default configuration provides MAA Silver-level protection against instance and hardware failures. Choose an architecture that meets specific RTO and RPO requirements for different failure scenarios.

- **Address regional limitations and cross-region requirements.** Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure operates within a single availability region where you create the instance. Multiregional resiliency requires more cross-region disaster recovery instances. Identify geographic distribution requirements for your compliance and data residency needs when you design your deployment topology.

## Implement Autonomous Data Guard for high availability

Oracle Autonomous Data Guard provides automated disaster recovery capabilities designed for Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure deployments. This enterprise-grade solution combines Oracle Data Guard technology with Fast Start Failover (FSFO) to provide continuous database protection with automatic failover capabilities and minimal administrative overhead.

- **Configure local standby databases for fast recovery.** Create a local standby database within the same region as your primary instance to achieve rapid failover with minimal data loss. Local standby configurations provide automatic failover capabilities with an RTO of two minutes and an RPO of 10 seconds. This configuration protects against instance-level failures while maintaining optimal performance.

- **Implement cross-region standby databases for site protection.** Deploy cross-region standby databases in paired Azure regions to protect against regional failures. Cross-region configurations provide an RTO of 15 minutes and an RPO of 1 minute. Manual failover is required for cross-region scenarios, but the solution ensures business continuity during major outages. For nonpaired regions, create a ticket to Oracle Support to enable the desired region for standby database deployment. For more information, see [Oracle's cross-region disaster recovery configuration guide](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/database-at-azure-autonomous/odadb-managing-autonomous-database-resources-azure.html#ODADB-GUID-18CEC6A2-9026-4BA4-ADA1-C79C2F8B8884).

- **Verify whether your workload is compatible with Autonomous Data Guard.** Oracle Autonomous Data Guard supports data warehouse and transaction processing workload types for disaster recovery scenarios. This disaster recovery solution doesn't support JSON database workloads and APEX application workload types. Evaluate your specific workload compatibility requirements before you implement Autonomous Data Guard for your Oracle database environment.

- **Prepare network infrastructure for cross-region deployment.** Ensure that resource groups, virtual networks, and delegated subnets exist in target regions before you configure cross-region disaster recovery. Network connectivity between primary and standby instances uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure-managed networking, which simplifies configuration and management.

## Deploy backup strategies for Oracle databases

Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure provides multiple enterprise-grade backup options to meet diverse recovery requirements across different business scenarios. These backup strategies complement high availability solutions and provide protection against data corruption, accidental deletion, security threats, and long-term compliance retention needs.

- **Use automatic backups for operational recovery.** Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure performs automatic backups continuously and stores data in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, which uses cross-availability domain replication. Automatic backups include 60-day full backups, daily incremental backups, and five-minute archive log backups. The backup data is immutable, and users can't delete or modify it.

- **Configure long-term backup retention for compliance.** Use the built-in, long-term backup feature to create long-term backups for retention periods from three months to 10 years. Schedule long-term backups as one-time operations or on a weekly, monthly, or yearly recurring schedule based on your compliance and business requirements. Long-term backups provide data protection beyond standard retention periods.

- **Enable cross-region backup replication for disaster recovery.** Configure cross-region backup replication to disaster recovery regions to enable restore operations during regional outages. Backup replication transfers data from the last seven days and takes several minutes to hours to complete, depending on backup size. This capability ensures data availability even when primary regions are unavailable.

- **Supplement backups by using Oracle Data Pump Export.** Use Oracle Data Pump Export to consistently export your database to manage data independently from automatic backups. Export data to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Files on defined schedules to provide extra data protection and migration capabilities. Data Pump Export provides flexibility for data movement and recovery scenarios.

## Configure application continuity for seamless failover

Application continuity features ensure minimal disruption to applications during Oracle database failover scenarios and planned maintenance operations. Oracle provides transparent application continuity technologies that automatically handle session recovery and transaction replay during database outages. These capabilities reduce application downtime and improve user experience.

- **Enable Transparent Application Continuity for session recovery.** Configure [Transparent Application Continuity for automatic session recovery](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/application-continuity-configure.html) to track session and transactional state automatically. This feature enables applications to restore session state to standby instances after database failover. Use this feature to minimize the application-level changes that you need to achieve high availability.

- **Use the appropriate connection strings for multiple-region deployments.** Applications must use connection strings or wallets downloaded from the same region as the primary database. When cross-region standby databases are configured, different wallets specify different hostnames. Construct manual connection strings that contain both the primary and standby hostnames when you have single connection string requirements. For more information, see [Cross-region Autonomous Data Guard configuration notes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/autonomous-data-guard-notes.html#GUID-78A76415-4EB9-4412-869F-3130AF7F5C82).

- **Test application behavior during failover scenarios.** Verify that applications handle database failover correctly by testing them regularly. Application continuity doesn't eliminate the need for application-level error handling and retry logic.

## Test and validate disaster recovery procedures

Regular disaster recovery testing ensures that BCDR solutions meet defined business objectives and identifies potential problems before disasters occur. Testing validates technical capabilities and operational procedures across all system components. It ensures reliable recovery performance.

- **Conduct regular disaster recovery drills across all application layers.** Perform scheduled failover and switchover operations to verify that you can achieve RTO and RPO requirements in real scenarios. Test all components of the application stack, not only the database layer, to ensure complete system recovery. Document test results and update procedures based on your findings.

- **Validate backup and restore operations.** Test restore procedures by using both automatic backups and long-term backups to verify data integrity and recovery times. Practice point-in-time recovery (PITR) scenarios to ensure that your workload can recover from specific points in time. Regular testing identifies potential problems with backup data before they affect production recovery.

- **Verify cross-region failover procedures.** Test manual failover procedures for cross-region disaster recovery scenarios to ensure that your operations teams understand the process and can complete it efficiently. Document step-by-step procedures and maintain current contact information for Oracle Support for when you need assistance.

## Evaluate other Oracle replication technologies

For specific enterprise use cases that require active-active database configurations or enhanced replication capabilities, other Oracle technologies provide advanced data replication and real-time integration features. These solutions extend beyond standard disaster recovery to support complex multiple-region deployment scenarios.

- **Evaluate Oracle GoldenGate for active-active environments.** Use [Oracle GoldenGate for real-time data integration](https://www.oracle.com/integration/goldengate/) and replication capabilities when you need active-active database configurations. This solution requires application-level awareness to handle conflict resolution effectively. Oracle GoldenGate isn't included in the Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure solution and requires separate licensing.

- **Design conflict resolution for multiple-master replication scenarios.** Implement application logic to handle data conflicts that can occur in active-active replication scenarios. Create business rules and technical controls to ensure data consistency across multiple database instances.
