# Manage and monitor Oracle Database@Azure

This article provides management and monitoring guidance for Oracle Database@Azure deployments. These recommendations enable comprehensive visibility, proactive issue resolution, and optimal performance across your Oracle Database@Azure infrastructure while integrating with Azure-native monitoring capabilities.

Oracle Database@Azure requires coordinated monitoring across database, infrastructure, and security layers. Implement these recommendations to establish robust monitoring practices that support operational excellence and business continuity for your Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure and Oracle Exadata Database@Azure services.

## Establish a comprehensive monitoring strategy

Implement a three-tier monitoring approach that provides visibility across database operations, infrastructure health, and security posture. This comprehensive strategy ensures complete operational coverage while avoiding monitoring gaps.

1. **Deploy a three-tier monitoring architecture.** Oracle Database@Azure provides monitoring capabilities across three distinct layers that work together to provide complete operational visibility. Deploy all three layers to ensure comprehensive coverage. This coverage includes virtual machine (VM) cluster monitoring through Azure Monitor, diagnostic log collection through Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, and individual VM monitoring through Azure Arc-enabled servers. For Azure Arc integration guidance, see [Azure Arc connectivity design for Oracle Database@Azure](azure-arc-connectivity-design.md).

1. **Configure Azure Monitor for VM cluster metrics.** Set up Azure Monitor to collect cluster-level performance metrics specific to your Oracle Database@Azure deployment type. Use [Oracle Exadata VM cluster metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/oracle-database-exadbvmclusters-metrics) for Exadata deployments, [Oracle VM cluster metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/oracle-database-cloudvmclusters-metrics) for standard clusters, and [Autonomous Database metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/oracle-database-autonomousdatabases-metrics) for Autonomous Database deployments.

1. **Enable diagnostic settings for enhanced observability.** Configure [diagnostic settings for Oracle Database@Azure](/azure/oracle/oracle-db/oracle-exadata-database-dedicated-infrastructure-logs) to collect comprehensive operational data. This configuration captures Exadata VM cluster life cycle management logs, database logs, infrastructure logs, and Data Guard logs through Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for centralized analysis.

1. **Integrate Azure Arc for infrastructure monitoring.** Enable [Azure Arc-enabled server monitoring](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/arc-enabled-servers/eslz-management-and-monitoring-arc-server) to monitor operating system level metrics, security events, and compliance status on each VM within the cluster. This integration provides unified governance while preserving existing OCI console functionality for database-specific operations.

## Configure critical performance monitoring

Establish proactive monitoring for key performance indicators that directly affect business operations. Configure alerts and thresholds that enable early detection of problems before they affect service availability.

1. **Monitor database performance metrics with appropriate thresholds.** Configure monitoring for critical database metrics by using proven thresholds that indicate potential problems. Set CPU utilization monitoring at 90% threshold with 5-minute collection frequency, storage utilization at 90% with 30-minute frequency, and memory usage at 90% with 15-minute frequency. For complete metric specifications, see the [database and cluster metrics reference table](#database-and-cluster-metrics).

1. **Implement Azure Arc agent monitoring for infrastructure health.** Monitor Azure Arc agent connectivity and health status to ensure continuous management capabilities. Configure Azure Arc agent status monitoring with 5-minute frequency and immediate alerting for disconnected status, Azure Arc-enabled server health monitoring with 10-minute frequency, and Azure Policy compliance monitoring with 30-minute frequency for configuration drift detection.

1. **Create unified monitoring dashboard.** Build a [custom dashboard in the Azure portal](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards) that aggregates metrics from all three monitoring layers. This unified view provides operators with complete visibility across database performance, infrastructure health, and security status without switching between multiple tools.

1. **Configure alert action groups for incident response.** Set up [Azure Monitor action groups](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) that automatically notify appropriate stakeholders when critical thresholds are exceeded. Configure escalation procedures that coordinate database administrators, infrastructure teams, and security personnel based on alert severity and type.

## Integrate security monitoring capabilities

Enhance operational security through integrated monitoring that combines Azure-native security tools with existing Oracle security practices. This integration provides comprehensive threat detection without duplicating existing security investments.

1. **Deploy Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration.** Integrate [Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) with Oracle Database@Azure infrastructure to provide comprehensive threat detection and security posture management. This integration enhances existing Oracle Advanced Security features with Azure-native threat intelligence and automated response capabilities.

1. **Create unified security monitoring dashboards.** Build security monitoring by using [Azure Monitor workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview) that combine Microsoft Defender security alerts, Oracle Enterprise Manager security monitoring, OCI security group events, and Azure Arc infrastructure compliance status. This unified approach provides complete security visibility across both platforms.

1. **Implement automated threat response workflows.** Configure [Defender workflow automation](/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation) and [security incident response procedures](/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts) with Oracle-specific considerations. Set up automated VM isolation that maintains database availability during security incidents and create incident tickets that include both Azure security context and Oracle operational impact assessment.

1. **Monitor security-focused metrics for compliance.** Track [Defender threat detection status](/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts) with 5-minute frequency for active threats, [security baseline compliance score](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-security-baseline) hourly with 80% threshold, and [vulnerability assessment status](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-dashboard-insights) daily for high and critical vulnerabilities.

For comprehensive security guidance, see [Security guidelines for Oracle Database@Azure](oracle-security-overview-odaa.md).

## Design a Log Analytics workspace strategy

Configure Log Analytics workspaces that complement existing Oracle monitoring while providing centralized analysis capabilities. Design workspace architecture that supports compliance requirements and operational efficiency.

1. **Plan workspace isolation based on compliance requirements.** Design [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview) architecture that aligns with existing Oracle audit and compliance requirements. Consider workspace isolation for different environments (production, development, testing) and data residency requirements that might affect log storage and analysis capabilities.

1. **Configure log retention policies aligned with Oracle audit requirements.** Set log retention policies that meet organizational compliance requirements while optimizing storage costs. Align Azure Monitor log retention with existing Oracle audit log retention policies to ensure consistent compliance coverage across both platforms.

1. **Establish clear monitoring boundaries between platforms.** Define clear boundaries between database-level monitoring handled through OCI and Azure-native metrics versus VM infrastructure monitoring handled through Azure Arc. This separation prevents monitoring overlap while ensuring complete coverage of all system components.

1. **Implement workspace access controls with role-based permissions.** Configure workspace access by using [Azure Monitor roles and permissions](/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security) that align with existing organizational responsibilities. Ensure database administrators have appropriate access to database metrics while infrastructure teams have access to VM-level monitoring data.

## Plan migration monitoring integration

Coordinate monitoring capabilities with migration planning to ensure visibility during data movement operations. Configure monitoring that supports your chosen migration methodology while maintaining operational oversight.

1. **Align monitoring with migration methodology.** Configure monitoring to support your chosen migration approach, whether you use Oracle Recovery Manager, Oracle Data Guard, Oracle Data Pump, or a Linux VM with the network file system (NFS) role. Each migration method requires specific monitoring focus areas to ensure successful data movement and validation.

1. **Extend monitoring across Azure regions when required.** If Oracle Database@Azure deployment spans multiple Azure regions, assess whether existing monitoring tools can extend capabilities to new regions. Plan for monitoring tool distribution and ensure seamless integration and functionality across all deployment regions.

1. **Coordinate with Oracle and Microsoft representatives for migration monitoring.** Engage Oracle and Microsoft representatives during migration planning to ensure monitoring configurations support migration validation and rollback procedures. This coordination ensures that monitoring capabilities align with migration timeline and success criteria.

1. **Document monitoring integration points for stakeholder communication.** Create documentation that identifies key stakeholders for different alert types and establishes clear communication procedures. Map monitoring alerts to appropriate response teams and define escalation procedures that coordinate database administrators, infrastructure teams, and business stakeholders.
