# Enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure

Enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure enables effective construction and operationalization of platform workload landing zones within the Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone by providing a specific architectural approach and reference implementation. You can use enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure after you successfully implement an enterprise-scale landing zone. Review the [enterprise-scale overview](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md) and [implementation guidance](../../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md) before you deploy enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure.

## Adopt enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure

Architecture for enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure architecture varies from customer to customer. Technical considerations and enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure design recommendations can lead to trade-offs based on each organization's particular scenario. Follow the core recommendations to find an architecture that sets your organization on a path to sustainable scaling. Enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure is modular by design, and you can customize environmental variables. This solution approach to landing zones includes the following assets to support your cloud teams:

- [Design guidelines](#design-guidelines)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [Implementation](#implementation)

## Design guidelines

You must make critical decisions that drive the design of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure enterprise-scale landing zone. Consider these six critical design areas:

- [Identity and access management](./eslz-identity-and-access-management.md)
- [Network topology and connectivity](./eslz-network-topology-and-connectivity.md)
- [Management and monitoring](./eslz-management-and-monitoring.md)
- [Business continuity and disaster recovery](./eslz-business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery.md)
- [Security, governance, and compliance](./eslz-security-governance-and-compliance.md)
- [Platform automation and DevOps](./eslz-platform-automation-and-devops.md)

## Architecture

The following diagram is a conceptual reference architecture that shows the six critical design areas:

## Implementation

The **SAP on Azure deployment automation framework** is a collection of processes combined with a flexible workflow. The [SAP deployment automation framework repository](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana) contains code for automatic deployment of SAP landscapes in the Azure cloud. Templates are split into the following categories:

- Terraform modules. These deploy infrastructure components in Azure, and they include:
  - VMs
  - Network
  - Storage
- Ansible playbooks. These run various that can:
  - Set up and deploy VMs
  - Install SAP HANA
  - Install other required applications

Deploy and install Ansible playbook components on the infrastructure that the Terraform modules build.
