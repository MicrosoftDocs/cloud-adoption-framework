# Business continuity and disaster recovery for an SAP migration

This article builds on some of the considerations and recommendations that are defined in the [Azure landing zone design area for BCDR](../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/management-business-continuity-disaster-recovery.md). The article can help you understand the unique constraints on any landing zone that supports an SAP platform. Because SAP is a mission-critical platform, you should also refer to the other guidance presented in the Azure landing zone **Design areas** section of this documentation and incorporate it into your design.

## Scenario and scope

Your architecture needs to incorporate principles that address on-premises business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) scenarios. These principles also apply on Azure. The main difference is that Azure might have more hardware capacity than your on-premises environment to compensate for a host failure. You can auto-recover even the largest Azure VMs by setting them up to restart on another server. Set up your Azure deployments to use the same conditions as your on-premises deployments. If you deployed on-premises systems or bare-metal hardware by using automatic failover cluster configurations, deploy them the same way on Azure. SAP applications that run an organization's most critical business processes require:
- Service and business process availability.
- Recovery time objectives (RTOs) for failure or disaster scenarios. 
- Recovery point objectives (RPOs) for failure scenarios. 
- Operational and lifecycle management tasks, and technology that fills in during failure scenarios. These management tasks include patching guest operating systems and database management systems, cloning, and refreshing SAP systems.

> [!TIP]
> Agree on a high availability and disaster recovery (HADR) solution for each of the archetypes in your SAP landscape early on. Ensure that all SAP components are covered with an appropriate solution.
> 
> Configure HADR on Azure early, in least one landscape, and keep it running there. Doing so gives your teams the opportunity to acquire experience on the technologies that are involved, which might be different from existing technologies. Configuring HADR early can also help you develop and evolve your standard operating procedures (SOP).
> 
> Plan to have complete high availability, disaster recovery, and backup protection for production workloads as soon as the system is live.

This article covers the following aspects of BCDR for an enterprise-scale SAP scenario:

- High availability within an Azure region.
- Backup and restore considerations.
- Criteria for deciding between cross-regional and regional disaster recovery.

## High availability within an Azure region

The following sections provide design considerations and recommendations for high availability within an Azure region for an SAP enterprise scenario.

### Design considerations for high availability

For high availability, the focus is to provide availability for SAP software's single point of failure, such as:

- Database management systems.
- Single points of failure in the application, like SAP ABAP and ASCS + SCS. Examples include SAP NetWeaver and the SAP S/4HANA architecture.
- Other tools, like SAP Web Dispatcher.

For other scenarios, don't restrict availability to infrastructure or software failures. Apply availability to all necessary lifecycle management tasks, like patching the OS in the VMs, the DBMS, and the SAP software. To minimize outages that might happen during planned downtime and lifecycle management operations, use common tools that help protect your systems against unplanned service disruptions.

SAP and SAP databases support automatic failover clusters. In Windows, Windows Server Failover Clustering supports failover. In Linux, Linux Pacemaker or third-party tools like SIOS Protection Suite and Veritas InfoScale support failover. With Azure, you can deploy only a subset high-availability configuration in your own datacenter.

To learn more about how Azure supports SAP, see [Supported scenarios for SAP workloads on Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-planning-supported-configurations) and [Supported scenarios for SAP HANA Large Instances](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-supported-scenario).

For the DBMS layer, the common architecture pattern is to replicate databases at the same time and with different storage stacks than the ones that the primary and secondary VMs use. Azure doesn't support architectures in which the primary and secondary VMs share storage for DBMS data. Nor does Azure support transaction or redo logs. The guiding principle is to use two independent storage stacks, even if they're based on Network File System (NFS) shares. This approach is the main limitation when you compare what's possible on-premises with what's possible on Azure.

Azure provides other options, as it supports either NFS or Server Message Block sharing. You can use [Azure shared disks](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-shared) in Windows for ASCS + SCS components and specific high-availability scenarios. Set up your failover clusters separately for SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer. Azure doesn't currently support high-availability architectures that combine SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer into one failover cluster.

Most failover clusters for SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer require a virtual IP address for a failover cluster. A common exception is when you use Oracle Data Guard. It doesn't require a virtual IP address. [Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) should handle the virtual IP address for all other cases. One design principle is to use one load balancer per cluster configuration. We recommend that you use the standard version of the load balancer. For more information, see [Public endpoint connectivity for virtual machines using Azure Standard Load Balancer in SAP high-availability scenarios](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-standard-load-balancer-outbound-connections).

For more information and options, see [high availability architecture and scenarios for SAP NetWeaver](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios).

Following are the platform-level SLAs for different high-availability deployment options. The partners providing the managed services provide the application-level SLA.

| Tier | HA scenario | Platform SLA |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Availability zone | 99.99% |
| Tier 2 | Availability set | 99.95% |
| Tier 3 | Single VM (self-healing) | 99.9% |

For more information, see the next section.

### Azure availability sets vs. availability zones

Before you deploy your high-availability infrastructure, and depending on the region you choose, determine whether to deploy with an [Azure availability set or an availability zone](/azure/virtual-machines/availability). The main differences for VMs deployed with an availability set are:

- The VMs aren't spread across different availability zones.
- The type of VMs that you can deploy through a single availability set are restricted because the host is defined by the first VM that's deployed in the set. One example result is that you won't be able to combine M-series and E-series VMs into one availability set.

An advantage of deploying your high-availability architecture across different availability zones is that your service level agreement (SLA) for the VMs can be higher. For details, see [Azure VM SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines). Depending on the Azure region, you might discover different network latency conditions in network traffic between VMs. For more information, see [SAP workload configurations with Azure availability zones](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-ha-availability-zones).

If you choose a zonal deployment approach, consider the effects of cross-zone latency for the chosen Azure region, between application server and database and between the two database nodes, on performance and architecture design choices.

If you use an active/passive zonal deployment for the application server tier (application servers must connect to the database in the same availability zone), build automation and an SOP to enable quick and automated recovery if there's a database failover.

If you use availability zones in your SAP solution, design all other Azure services and infrastructure components in your SAP landscape for zone redundancy too so that you can achieve true zone redundancy. Examples of services and components to take into account are Azure ExpressRoute gateways, Azure Load Balancer, Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, reverse proxy, firewalls, antivirus, and backup infrastructure.

### Design recommendations for high availability

- Azure provides several options to help you meet your application's infrastructure SLAs. You should choose the same option for all three SAP components: central services, application server, and database. For information about SLAs for VMs, availability sets, and availability zones, see [SLA for Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9).

- When you deploy VMs in an availability set, the alignment with fault and update domains prevents the VMs from being on the same host hardware, which provides protection against hardware failure. When you deploy VMs via availability zones and use different zones, the VMs are created across different physical locations. This configuration provides additional protection from power, cooling, or networking issues that affect the datacenters of the zone as a whole. However, you can't deploy Azure availability sets within an Azure availability zone unless you use [proximity placement groups](/azure/virtual-machines/co-location). 

    If you choose a zonal deployment approach, the SAP DBMS, central services, and application layers run in different availability zones. However, each availability zone will most likely have multiple application servers. In this scenario, the application servers in each zone don't automatically benefit from fault domains and update domains. You can achieve those benefits by using availability sets as described in [Azure proximity placement groups for optimal network latency with SAP](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-proximity-placement-scenarios).

- When you create availability sets, use the maximum number of fault domains and update domains available. For example, if you deploy more than two VMs in one availability set, use the maximum number of fault domains (three) and enough update domains to limit the effect of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions, in addition to Azure planned maintenance. The default number of fault domains is two, and you can't change it online later.

- In an availability set deployment, each component of an SAP system needs to be in its own availability set. SAP central services, the database, and application VMs should be in their own availability sets.

- When you use Azure proximity placement groups in an availability set deployment, all three SAP components (central services, application server, and database) should be in the same proximity placement group.

- If you use proximity placement groups, use one per SAP SID. Groups don't span across availability zones or Azure regions.

- When you use Azure proximity placement groups in an availability zones deployment, the two SAP components (central services and application server) should be in the same proximity placement group. The database VMs in the two zones are no longer a part of the proximity placement groups. The proximity placement groups per zone are scoped with the deployment of the VM that runs the SAP ASCS + SCS instances. The advantage of this configuration is that you have more flexibility in resizing VMs. It's also easier to move to new VM types in either the DBMS layer or the application layer of the SAP system.

- Azure doesn't currently support combining ASCS and database high availability in a single Linux Pacemaker cluster. Separate them into individual clusters. You can combine as many as five [multiple central services clusters](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-suse-multi-sid) in a pair of VMs.

- Use a Standard Load Balancer SKU in front of ASCS and database clusters.
- Run all production systems on Premium managed SSDs and use Azure NetApp Files or Ultra Disk Storage. At least the OS disk should be on the Premium tier so you can achieve better performance and the best SLA.
- Deploy both VMs in the high-availability pair in an availability set or in availability zones. These VMs should be the same size and have the same storage configuration.
- Use native database replication technology to synchronize the database in a high-availability pair.
- Use one of the following services to run SAP central services clusters, depending on the operating system:

  - [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pacemaker cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-suse-netapp-files). Azure fence agent and as many as three STONITH block devices (SBDs) are supported.
  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Pacemaker cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-rhel-netapp-files). SBD isn't currently supported. Only Azure fence agent is supported.
  - [Windows cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-ascs-ha-multi-sid-wsfc-shared-disk).
  - SAP-certified third-party cluster software.

- Set up the cluster timeout parameters as recommended in the documentation for central services and database clusters.

### Storage for SAP workloads

- Choosing the right storage options is a part of designing for resiliency for your SAP workload. The design for SAP workloads on Azure storage is intended to keep latency to a minimum and maximize throughput. Consider your implementation and how the following guidance can help you make architectural decisions for your SAP on Azure implementation. For information on the various types of storage and their compatibility with SAP workloads and components, see [Azure Storage types for SAP workloads](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/planning-guide-storage).

- You should run SAP HANA on Azure only on the types of storage that are certified by SAP. Note that certain volumes must be run on certain disk configurations, where applicable. These configurations include enabling Write Accelerator and using Premium storage. You also need to ensure that the file system that runs on storage is compatible with the DBMS that runs on the machine. For more information, see [Storage configurations for SAP HANA](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage).

- In addition to Azure managed data disks that are attached to VMs, various Azure-native shared storage solutions are used to run SAP applications on Azure. Your high-availability configuration might differ, because some storage services that are available on Azure aren't supported by Azure Site Recovery. The following storage types are typically used for SAP workloads.

  |Storage type|High-availability configuration support|
  | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
  | Azure shared disks (LRS or ZRS)  | Windows Server Failover Cluster. For configuration details, see [Design SAP HA with Windows Server failover clustering](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-guide-wsfc-shared-disk) . | 
  | NFS on Azure Files (LRS or ZRS) | Pacemaker-based cluster on Linux environments. Be sure to check the [availability of NFS in different regions.](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=storage&regions=all). |
  | NFS on Azure NetApp Files       | Pacemaker-based cluster on Linux environments. For more information, see [Azure NetApp Files for SAP virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-netapp).  |
  | SMB on Azure Files (LRS or ZRS) | Windows Server Failover Cluster. For configuration details, see [High availability for SAP NetWeaver on Azure VMs on Windows with Azure Files Premium SMB for SAP applications](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-windows-azure-files-smb).  |
  | SMB on Azure NetApp Files       | Windows Server Failover Cluster. For configuration details, see [High availability for SAP NetWeaver on Azure VMs on Windows with Azure NetApp Files (SMB) for SAP applications](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-windows-netapp-files-smb). |

- Instead of Azure-native shared storage services, you can use traditional NFS clusters (based on DRBD replication), GlusterFS, or Cluster Shared Volume with Storage Spaces Direct as an alternative shared storage solution to run SAP workloads on Azure. These choices are especially useful when Azure-native shared storage services are either not available in the targeted Azure region or don't support the target architecture. For information about storage service availability, see [Azure products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).
- To learn about storage options that are available for SAP workloads on Azure, see the [storage recommendations and guidelines for setting up disaster recovery](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/disaster-recovery-overview-guide#storage). 

## Backup and restore

The following sections describe design considerations and recommendations for backup and restore in an SAP scenario.

Although backup and restore isn't typically considered an adequate high-availability solution for a production SAP workload, the technology provides other benefits. Most companies that use SAP applications need to follow compliance regulations that require the storage of backups for many years. It's also essential to have a backup and be able to restore from it in other scenarios. The assumption is that you've already established and are following backup and restore best practices for SAP applications, which means that you can:

- Perform a point-in-time recovery for your production databases at any point, in a time frame that meets your RTO. Point-in-time recovery typically provides protection from operator errors like deleting data, either on the DBMS layer or through SAP.

- Maintain a store to keep your long-term backups in order to meet compliance regulations.
- Use database backups to clone the SAP system and restore the backups against another server or VM.
- Use production database data from database backups to refresh nonproduction systems.
- Back up SAP application servers and VMs, disks, or VM snapshots.

When you back up and restore on-premises, you need to bring these capabilities to SAP systems in Azure.

If you're satisfied with your current solution, check whether your backup vendor supports Azure deployments or whether it has a software as a service (SaaS) solution for Azure.

Azure provides a backup SaaS service, [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview), which takes VM snapshots and manages streaming [SQL Server](/azure/backup/backup-azure-sql-database) and [SAP HANA](/azure/backup/sap-hana-db-about) backups. If you use [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/netapp) to store your SAP HANA databases, you can run backups based on HANA-consistent storage snapshots.

### Design recommendations for backup and restore

- You can use Azure Backup to back up SAP application server and central services VMs.

- You can use an SAP HANA backup for HANA deployments of up to 8 TB. For more information, see the support matrix for [backing up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs](/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix).

- If you use an IaaS backup solution, size the backup infrastructure to ensure that it can back up all production-sized systems simultaneously or as in a real-life scenario, within expected time frames and by using a production setup or a similar setup in terms of networking, security, and so on.

- Test the backup and recovery times to verify that they meet your RTO requirements for restoring all systems simultaneously after a disaster.

- Ideally, avoid pulling your backups from Azure into your on-premises backup infrastructure, especially for large databases. Doing so affects how much bandwidth the ExpressRoute circuits use.

- Load-test the backup and recovery tools as part of the performance test plan.

## Disaster recovery

The following sections describe design considerations and recommendations for disaster recovery in an SAP scenario. 

### Design considerations for disaster recovery

The [Azure region map](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) shows more than 65 Azure regions, and not all of them run the same services. For larger SAP software deployments, especially those that use SAP HANA, look for Azure regions that offer Azure [M-series](/azure/virtual-machines/m-series) or [Mv2-series](/azure/virtual-machines/mv2-series) VMs. Azure Storage also pairs different regions to replicate a smaller subset of storage types to another region. For more information, see [Overview of Azure paired regions](/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions).

The main challenges of pairing Azure regions for SAP workloads are:

- The pairs aren't always consistent with M-series or Mv2-series VM services. Many organizations that deploy their SAP systems don't use Azure paired regions. Instead, they choose regions based on the availability of required VM types.
- You can replicate standard storage between paired regions, but you can't use standard storage to store your databases or virtual hard disks. You can replicate backups only between paired regions that you use. For all your other data, run your replication by using native DBMS features like SQL Server Always On or SAP HANA System Replication. Use a combination of Site Recovery, `rsync` or `robocopy`, and other third-party software for the SAP application layer.

- If a disaster occurs, multiple affected customers in an Azure region will want to fail over to the corresponding paired DR region. This situation leads to competition of resources to bring up dormant VMs in the DR region. The workaround is to run nonproduction systems in the DR region and use the same resources to host DR replicas of production systems. This dual-purpose use of Azure infrastructures in the DR region helps you avoid resource capacity constraints.

Another important consideration is to secure the required operating capacity in the disaster region. If a disaster occurs, you might need to run the SAP application for a minimal window of time with minimal IT capacity and by critical human resources only while you work to recover normal operation in the primary region. This requires that you have minimal IT infrastructure available in the DR region.  

After you define your Azure regions, you need to choose a deployment pattern:

- Will you deploy production systems into your primary region?
- Will you deploy nonproduction SAP systems into the disaster recovery region?
- Will you use an architecture that groups all SAP systems into the primary region? This configuration ensures that the disaster recovery region is used only for disaster recovery.

Most organizations use both regions for operating SAP systems. Organizations that run complete copies of production systems as business-regression test systems typically plan to use the SAP product line's business-regression test system as a disaster recovery target.

When you choose a disaster recovery region, be sure to have ExpressRoute connectivity to that region. If you have multiple ExpressRoute circuits connecting to Azure, at least one of those circuits must connect to the primary Azure region. The others should connect to the disaster recovery region. This type of architecture connects you to the Azure network in a different geographic/geopolitical area and helps protect your connection if a catastrophe affects one of the Azure regions.

Some organizations use a combination high-availability and disaster-recovery architecture, which groups high availability with disaster recovery in the same Azure region. But grouping high availability with disaster recovery isn't ideal. [Azure availability zones](/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) support this architecture. Because the distance between availability zones within one Azure region isn't as large as the distance between two Azure regions, a natural disaster could jeopardize the application services in the region where it occurs. You also need to consider the latency between SAP application servers and database servers. Per [SAP Note 1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926), a roundtrip time of less than or equal to 0.3 ms is a good value, and a time of less than or equal to 0.7 ms is a moderate value. Therefore, for zones with high latencies, operational procedures need to be in place to ensure that SAP application servers and database servers are running in the same zone at all times. Organizations choose this architecture for the following reasons:

- Compliance is sufficient with configurations that support smaller distances between production deployment and a disaster recovery target.
- Data sovereignty is a factor.
- Geopolitical factors are involved.
- It's a low-cost option that supports zonal failures, sometimes combined with backup transfer to the secondary region for natural catastrophes that have a large radius of impact.

Another factor to consider when you choose your disaster recovery region is the RPO and RTO for failing over to the disaster recovery site. The greater the distance between the production and disaster recovery regions, the higher the network latency. Although you replicate asynchronously between Azure regions, network latency can affect the throughput you can replicate and the RPO target. You can often minimize your RPO by using a combined high availability and disaster recovery architecture. But this configuration poses a potentially higher risk from large-scale natural disasters.

### Design recommendations for disaster recovery

- Ensure that the classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) for the primary virtual network doesn't conflict or overlap with the CIDR of the disaster recovery site's virtual network.
- Set up ExpressRoute connections from on-premises to the primary and secondary Azure disaster recovery regions.
- As an alternative to using ExpressRoute, consider setting up VPN connections from on-premises to the primary and secondary Azure disaster recovery regions.
- Use Site Recovery to replicate an application server to a disaster recovery site. Site Recovery can also help you replicate central services cluster VMs to the disaster recovery site. When you invoke disaster recovery, you need to reconfigure the Linux Pacemaker cluster on the disaster recovery site. For example, you need to replace the VIP or SBD, run corosync.conf, and so on.
- Replicate key vault contents like certificates, secrets, or keys across regions so you can decrypt data in the DR region.
- Use [cross-region replication in Azure NetApp Files](/azure/azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-introduction) (currently in public preview) to synchronize file volumes between the primary region and the disaster recovery region.
- Use native database replication, rather than Site Recovery, to synchronize data to the disaster recovery site.
- Peer the primary and disaster recovery virtual networks. For example, for HANA System Replication, an SAP HANA DB virtual network needs to be peered to the disaster recovery site's SAP HANA DB virtual network.
- If you use Azure NetApp Files storage for your SAP deployments, at a minimum, create two Azure NetApp Files accounts in the Premium tier, in two regions.
- Consider grouping systems based on their business importance and proximity dependency based on application performance. Deploy each group to a separate region in a paired region construct to minimize the business impact of a regional outage. For example, two critical ECC systems serving two different business units can be deployed in UK South and UK West to minimize the impact of a regional outage.
