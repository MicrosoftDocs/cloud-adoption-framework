# Business continuity and disaster recovery for an SAP migration

This article builds on some of the considerations and recommendations defined in [Azure landing zone design area for BCDR](../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/management-business-continuity-disaster-recovery.md). This article helps you understand the unique constraints on any landing zone that supports an SAP platform. But because SAP is a mission-critical platform, you should refer to the guidance on the Azure landing zone design areas and include them in your design.

## Scenario and scope

Your organization or enterprise must design platform-level capabilities that help application workloads meet their specific requirements. SAP applications that run an organization's most critical business processes require:

- Service/business process availability.
- Recovery time objectives (RTOs) during failure or disaster scenarios. For example, you might see a failure scenario limited to a component of the SAP system or a widespread failure that affects a datacenter or Azure region.
- Recovery point objectives (RPOs) for a failure scenario limited to a component of an SAP system or a widespread failure that affect a datacenter or an Azure region.
- Operational and lifecycle management tasks with technology that fills in for failure scenarios. These management tasks include patching guest operating systems and database management systems, cloning, and refreshing the SAP systems.

Your architecture must factor in many principles and tasks to address on-premises business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) scenarios. These principles and tasks also apply in Azure. The main difference is that Azure might have more hardware capacity than your organization to compensate for a host failure. You can service-heal even the largest Azure VMs by setting them up to restart on another server. Set up your Azure deployments to use the same conditions as your on-premises deployments. If you deployed on-premises systems or bare-metal hardware by using automatic failover cluster configurations, deploy them the same way in Azure.

This article covers the following aspects of BCDR for an enterprise-scale SAP scenario:

- High availability within an Azure region.
- Back up and restore considerations.
- Cross-regional versus regional disaster recovery decision criteria.

## High availability within an Azure region

Review design considerations and recommendations for high availability within an Azure region for an SAP enterprise scenario.

### Design considerations for high availability

With high availability, the focus is to provide availability for SAP software's single point of failure, such as with:

- Database management systems.
- Single points of failure in the application, like ABAP SAP ASCS/SCS. Examples include SAP NetWeaver and the SAP S/4HANA architecture.
- Other tools, like SAP Web Dispatcher.

For other scenarios, don't restrict availability to infrastructure or software failures. Apply availability to all necessary lifecycle management tasks, like patching the OS in the VMs, the DBMS, or the SAP software. To minimize outages that might happen during planned downtime and lifecycle management tasks, use common tools that protect against unplanned service disruptions.

SAP and SAP databases support automatic failover clusters. In Windows, the Windows Server Failover Clustering feature supports failover. In Linux, Linux Pacemaker or third-party tools like SIOS Protection Suite or Veritas InfoScale support failover. With Azure, you can only deploy a subset high availability configuration in your own datacenter.

To learn more about how Azure supports SAP, see [Supported scenarios for SAP workload on Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-planning-supported-configurations) and [Supported scenarios for SAP HANA Large Instances](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-supported-scenario) to learn more about what Azure supports for SAP.

For the DBMS layer, the common architecture pattern is to replicate databases at the same time and with different storage stacks than the ones that the primary and secondary VMs are using. Azure doesn't support architectures where the primary and secondary VM share storage for DBMS data. Nor does Azure support transaction and redo logs. The guiding principle is to use two independent storage stacks, even if they're based on Network File System (NFS) shares. But this approach is the main limitation when compared to what's possible with on-premises.

Azure provides other options, as it supports either NFS or Server Message Block sharing. You can use [Azure shared disk](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-shared) in Windows for ASCS/SCS components and specific high availability scenarios. Set up your failover clusters separately for SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer. Azure doesn't support high availability architectures that combine SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer into one failover cluster.

Most failover clusters for SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer require a virtual IP address for a failover cluster. One common exception is with Oracle Data Guard. It doesn't require a virtual IP address. [Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) should handle the virtual IP address for all other cases. As a design principle, use one Load Balancer per cluster configuration. We recommend using the standard version of the load balancer. For more information, see [Public endpoint connectivity for virtual machines using Azure Standard Load Balancer in SAP high availability scenarios](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-standard-load-balancer-outbound-connections).

Explore [high availability architecture and scenarios for SAP NetWeaver](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios) for more information and options.

### Azure availability sets versus availability zones

Before you deploy your high availability infrastructure and depending on the region you've chosen, choose whether to deploy through an [Azure availability set](/azure/virtual-machines/availability) or an availability zone. The main differences for VMs deployed with an availability set are:

- The VMs aren't spread across different availability zones.
- The type of VMs that you can deploy through a single availability set are restricted because the host is defined by the first VM deployed in the set. One example result is that you won't be able to combine M-series and E-series VMs into one availability set.

One advantage of deploying your high availability architecture across different availability zones is that your service level agreement (SLA) for the VMs can be higher. For details, review [Azure VM SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines). Depending on the Azure region, you might discover different network latency conditions in network traffic between VMs. Read through [SAP workload configurations with Azure availability zones](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-ha-availability-zones) for more information about SAP workload deployments across different availability zones.

### Design recommendations for high availability

- Azure offers several options to help you meet your applications infrastructure SLAs. You should choose the same option for all the three SAP components: central services, application server, and database.

  - A single VM SLA offers 99.9 percent.
  - Availability set deployment offers 99.95 percent.
  - Availability zones offer 99.99 percent.

- In an availability set deployment, each component of an SAP system has to be in its own availability set. SAP central services, database, and application VMs should be grouped in their availability sets.

- When you're using Azure proximity placement groups in an availability set deployment, all three SAP components (central services, application server, and database) should be in the same proximity placement group.

- Use one proximity placement group per SAP SID. Groups don't span across availability zones or Azure regions.

- When you're using Azure proximity placement groups in an availability zones deployment, the two SAP components (central services and application server) should be in the same proximity placement group. The database VMs in the two zones are no longer a part of the proximity placement groups. The proximity placement groups per zone are now scoped with the deployment of the VM running the SAP ASCS/SCS instances. The advantage of this new configuration is that you have more flexibility in resizing VMs. It's also easier to move to new VM types with either the DBMS layer or the application layer of the SAP system.

- Azure doesn't currently support combining ASCS and db high availability in the same Linux Pacemaker cluster; separate them into individual clusters. But you can combine up to five [multiple central-services clusters](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-suse-multi-sid) into a pair of VMs.

- Use a Standard Load Balancer SKU in front of ASCS and database clusters.
- All production systems should run on premium-managed SSDs and use Azure NetApp Files or Ultra Disk Storage. At least the OS disk should be Premium tier to achieve better performance and the best SLA.
- Both VMs in the high availability pair should be deployed in an availability set, or availability zones should be the same size and have the same storage configuration.
- Native database replication technology should be used to synchronize the database in a high availability pair.
- One of the following services should be selected for running SAP central-services clusters on different operating systems:

  - [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pacemaker cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-suse-netapp-files): Supports up to three STONITH block devices (SBDs) or Azure Fence Agent.
  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Pacemaker cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-rhel-netapp-files): SBD isn't supported yet; only Azure Fence Agent is supported.
  - [Windows cluster](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-ascs-ha-multi-sid-wsfc-shared-disk)
  - SAP-certified third-party cluster software.

- You should set up the cluster timeout parameters recommended in the documentation for central-services and database clusters.


### Storage for SAP Workloads

**Design Considerations for storage:**

- Designing for resiliency for your SAP workload includes choosing the right storage options available. The design for SAP Workloads on Azure storage is intended keep latency to a minimum and maximize throughput. You will have to consider your specific implementation and how the guidance below can help make architectural decisions for your SAP on Azure implementation. In order to understand the different types of storage and their capability and usability with SAP workloads and SAP components, please read [Azure Storage Types](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/planning-guide-storage) for SAP Workload.

- SAP HANA on Azure should be run on only the types of storage that are certified by SAP. Please take note that certain volumes must be run on certain disk configurations, including enable Write Accelerator and choosing Premium storage, where applicable. Another consideration is to ensure that the filesystem that will run on the chosen storage needs to be compatible with the DBMS that will run on the machine. In order to understand the different types of storage configurations for SAP HANA please read [Storage Configurations for SAP HANA](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage) for more information.

- An option for NFS shares when running SAP Workloads on Azure is to use Azure NetApp Files. ANF has its own throughput and sizing considerations. Please see the information regarding [Azure NetApp Files for SAP virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-netapp).

### Backup/restore

### Design recommendations for backup and restore

- You can use Azure Backup to back up SAP application server and central-services VMs.
- You can use an SAP HANA backup for HANA deployments up to 8 TB. For more information, explore the support matrix for [backing up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs](/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix).
- Test the backup and recovery times to verify if they meet your RTO.
- Ideally, avoid pulling your backups from Azure into your on-premises backup infrastructure, especially with large databases. This option impacts how much bandwidth the ExpressRoute circuits consume.

## Backup and restore

Review design considerations and recommendations for backup and restore in an SAP enterprise scenario.

### Design considerations for backup and restore

Though backup and restore aren't typically considered as adequate high availability functionality for a production SAP workload, this technology covers various other areas. Most companies that use SAP applications need to follow compliance regulations that require backups to be stored for many years. There are also other conditions and scenarios where it's essential to have a backup and be able to restore from it. The assumption is that you've already established and follow backup and restore best practices for deploying SAP applications, which means that you can:

- Perform a point-in-time recovery for your production databases at any point and in a time frame that meets your RTO. Point-in-time recovery typically includes operator errors like deleting data, either on the DBMS layer or through SAP.

- Maintain a store to keep your long-term backups to meet compliance regulations.
- Use database backups to clone the SAP system and restore the backups against another server or VM.
- Use production database data from database backups to refresh nonproduction systems.
- Back up SAP application servers and VMs, disks, or VM snapshots.

When you back up and restore on-premises, you need to bring these capabilities to SAP systems in Azure.

If you're satisfied with your current solution, check if your backup vendor supports Azure deployments or if they've set up a software as a service (SaaS) solution in Azure.

Azure offers a backup SaaS service, [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview), which takes VM snapshots and manages streaming [SQL Server](/azure/backup/backup-azure-sql-database) and [SAP HANA](/azure/backup/sap-hana-db-about) backups. If you're using [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/netapp/) to store your SAP HANA databases, you can run backups based on HANA-consistent storage snapshots.

### Design recommendations for backup and restore

- You can use Azure Backup to back up SAP application server and central-services VMs.
- You can use an SAP HANA backup for HANA deployments up to 8 TB. For more information, explore the support matrix for [backing up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs](/azure/backup/sap-hana-backup-support-matrix).
- Test the backup and recovery times to verify if they meet your RTO.
- Ideally, avoid pulling your backups from Azure into your on-premises backup infrastructure, especially with large databases. This option impacts how much bandwidth the ExpressRoute circuits consume.

## Disaster recovery

Review design considerations and recommendations for disaster recovery in an SAP enterprise scenario. 

### Design considerations for disaster recovery

The [Azure region map](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) shows over 60 Azure regions, and not all of them run the same services. In larger SAP software deployments, and especially ones that use SAP HANA, look for Azure regions that offer Azure [M-series](/azure/virtual-machines/m-series) and/or [Mv2-series](/azure/virtual-machines/mv2-series) VMs. Azure Storage also pairs different regions to replicate a smaller subset of storage types to another region. For more information, see [Overview of Azure paired regions](/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions).

The main challenges of pairing Azure regions for SAP workloads are:

- The pairs aren't always consistent with M-series or Mv2-series VM services. Many customers who deploy their SAP systems don't follow Azure paired regions. Instead, they follow the service availability of required VM families.
- You can replicate standard storage between paired regions, but you can't use standard storage to store your databases or virtual hard disks. You can replicate backups only between paired regions that you use. For all your other data, run your own replications with native DBMS features like SQL Server Always On, SAP HANA System Replication, and other services. Use a combination of Azure Site Recovery, `rsync` or `robocopy`, and other third-party software for the SAP application layer.

After you define your Azure regions, your organization must choose one of these deployment patterns:

- Whether you're going to deploy production systems into your primary region.
- Deploy nonproduction SAP systems into the disaster recovery region.
- Or if you're going to use an architecture that groups all SAP systems into the primary region. This configuration ensures that the disaster recovery region is only used for disaster recovery regions.

The current SAP customer deployment pattern shows most customers use both regions for SAP systems that are operating. Customers that run complete copies of their production systems as business regression test systems typically plan to use the SAP product line's business regression test system as a disaster recovery target.

Another important design factor for determining which of at least two Azure regions should be the disaster recovery region is if you have multiple Azure ExpressRoute circuits connecting to Azure. At least one ExpressRoute circuit must connect to the primary Azure region. And the other(s) should connect to the disaster recovery region. This type of architecture connects you to the Azure network in a different geographic area and guards your connection if a catastrophe affects another Azure region.

Some customers use a combination high availability and disaster recovery architecture, which groups high availability with disaster recovery in the same Azure region. But grouping high availability with disaster recovery isn't ideal. [Azure availability zones](/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) support this architecture. Since the distance between availability zones within one Azure region isn't as large as the distance between two different Azure regions, a natural disaster could jeopardize the architecture in the region where it occurs. Customers choose this architecture because of:

- Sufficient compliance with configurations that support smaller distances between production deployment and a disaster recovery target.
- Data sovereignty aspects.
- Geopolitical factors.

Another factor to consider when choosing your disaster recovery region is the RPO and RTO for failing over to the disaster recovery site. The greater the distance between the production and disaster recovery regions, the larger the network latency. Though you would replicate asynchronously between different Azure regions, a smaller or larger network latency can affect the throughput you're able to replicate and the RPO target. You can often minimize your recovery point objectives (RPO) by using high availability and disaster recovery architecture. But this configuration poses a potentially higher risk from large-scale, natural disasters.

### Design recommendations for disaster recovery

- The classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) for the primary virtual network shouldn't conflict or overlap with the CIDR of the disaster recovery site's virtual network.
- Set up ExpressRoute connections from on-premises to the primary and secondary Azure disaster recovery region.
- An alternative to using ExpressRoute is to set up VPN connections from on-premises to the primary and secondary Azure disaster recovery region.
- Use Site Recovery to replicate an application server to a disaster recovery site. Site Recovery also helps with replicating central-services cluster VMs to the disaster recovery site. When you invoke disaster recovery, you'll need to reconfigure the Linux Pacemaker cluster on the disaster recovery site. For example, you replace the VIP or SBD, run `corosync.conf`, and so on).
- Use [cross-region replication in Azure NetApp Files](/azure/azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-introduction) (currently in public preview) to synchronize file volumes between the primary region and the disaster recovery region.
- Use native database replication to synchronize data to the disaster recovery site, rather than Azure Site Recovery.
- Peer the primary and disaster recovery virtual networks. For example, for HANA System Replication, an SAP HANA DB virtual network needs to be peered to the disaster recovery site's SAP HANA DB virtual network.
- If you use Azure NetApp Files storage for your SAP deployments, at a minimum, create two Azure NetApp Files accounts in two different regions at the Premium tier.
