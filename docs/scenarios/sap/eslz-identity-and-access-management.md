# Identity and access management for SAP

This article builds on several considerations and recommendations defined in the article [Azure landing zone design area for identity and access management](../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/identity-access.md). This article describes the identity and access-management recommendations for deploying an SAP platform on Microsoft Azure. SAP is a mission-critical platform, so you should include the Azure landing zone design area guidance in your design.

> SAP SE has [sunset](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101) the SAP Identity Management (IDM) product and recommends all its customers to migrate to [Microsoft Entra ID Governance](/entra/id-governance/scenarios/migrate-from-sap-idm).

## Design considerations

- Review the required Azure administration and management activities for your team. Consider your SAP on Azure landscape. Determine the best possible distribution of responsibilities within your organization.

- Determine the Azure resource administration boundaries versus the SAP Basis administration boundaries between the infrastructure and SAP Basis teams. Consider providing the SAP Basis team with elevated Azure resource administration access in an SAP non-production environment. For example, give them a [Virtual Machine Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role. You can also give them partially elevated administration access, like partial Virtual Machine Contributor in a production environment. Both options achieve a good balance between the separation of duties and operational efficiency.

- For central IT and SAP Basis teams, consider using Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and multifactor authentication to access SAP Virtual Machine resources from the Azure portal and the underlying infrastructure.

Here are common administration and management activities of SAP on Azure:

| Azure resource | Azure resource provider | Activities |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual machines | Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines | Start, stop, restart, deallocate, deploy, redeploy, change, resize, extensions, availability sets, proximity placement groups |
| Virtual machines | Microsoft.Compute/disks | Read and write to disk |
| Storage | Microsoft.Storage | Read, change on storage accounts (for example, boot diagnostics) |
| Storage | Microsoft.NetApp | Read, change on NetApp capacity pools and volumes |
| Storage | Microsoft.NetApp | ANF snapshots |
| Storage | Microsoft.NetApp | ANF cross-region replication |
| Networking | Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces | Read, create, and change network interfaces |
| Networking | Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers | Read, create, and change load balancers |
| Networking | Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups | Read NSG |
| Networking | Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls | Read firewall |

- Secure Network File System (NFS) communication between Azure NetApp Files and Azure Virtual Machines with [NFS client encryption using Kerberos](/azure/azure-netapp-files/configure-kerberos-encryption). Azure NetApp Files supports Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Microsoft Entra Domain Services for Microsoft Entra connections. Consider the [performance effect of Kerberos on NFS v4.1](/azure/azure-netapp-files/configure-kerberos-encryption#kerberos_performance).

- Secure Remote Function Call (RFC) connections between SAP systems with secure network communications (SNC) by using appropriate protection levels, like quality of protection (QoP). SNC protection generates some performance overhead. To protect RFC communication between application servers of the same SAP system, SAP recommends using network security instead of SNC. The following Azure services support SNC-protected RFC connections to an SAP target system: Providers of Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, the self-hosted integration runtime in Azure Data Factory, and the on-premises data gateway in case of Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, Azure Analysis Services, and Azure Logic Apps. SNC is required to configure single sign-on (SSO) in these cases.

### SAP user governance and provisioning

- Consider that a migration to Azure might be an opportunity to review and realign identity and access management processes. Review the processes in your SAP landscape and the processes at your enterprise level:
  - Review the SAP dormant user lockout policies.
  - Review the SAP user password policy and align it with Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Review the leavers, movers, and starters (LMS) procedures and align them with Microsoft Entra ID. If you're using SAP Human Capital Management (HCM), SAP HCM likely drives the LMS process.

- Consider using [SAP principal propagation](/power-platform/sap/connect/entra-id-apim-oauth) to forward a Microsoft identity to your SAP landscape.

- Consider Microsoft Entra provisioning service to automatically provision and deprovision users and groups to [SAP Analytics Cloud](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-analytics-cloud-provisioning-tutorial), [SAP Identity Authentication](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-provisioning-tutorial), and more SAP services.

- Consider provisioning users from [SuccessFactors](/entra/identity/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-cloud-only-tutorial) into Microsoft Entra ID, with optional write-back of email address to SuccessFactors.

## Design recommendations

- [Migrate](/entra/id-governance/scenarios/migrate-from-sap-idm) your SAP Identity Management (IDM) solution to Microsoft Entra ID Governance.

- Implement SSO by using Windows AD, Microsoft Entra ID, or AD FS, depending on the access type, so that the end users can connect to SAP applications without a user ID and password once the central identity provider successfully authenticates them.
  - Implement SSO to SAP SaaS applications like [SAP Analytics Cloud](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sapboc-tutorial), [SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-hana-cloud-platform-tutorial), [Business by design](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial), [SAP Qualtrics](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/qualtrics-tutorial) and [SAP C4C](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-customer-cloud-tutorial) with Microsoft Entra ID using SAML.
  - Implement SSO to [SAP NetWeaver](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-netweaver-tutorial)-based web applications like [SAP Fiori](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-fiori-tutorial) and SAP Web GUI by using SAML.
  - You can implement SSO to SAP GUI by using SAP NetWeaver SSO or a partner solution.
  - For SSO for SAP GUI and web browser access, implement SNC â€“ Kerberos/SPNEGO (simple and protected GSSAPI negotiation mechanism) due to its ease of configuration and maintenance. For SSO with X.509 client certificates, consider the SAP Secure Login Server, which is a component of the SAP SSO solution.
  - Implement [SSO by using OAuth for SAP NetWeaver](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-netweaver-tutorial#configure-sap-netweaver-for-oauth) to allow third-party or custom applications to access SAP NetWeaver OData services.
  - Implement [SSO to SAP HANA](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/saphana-tutorial)

- Implement Microsoft Entra ID as identity provider for SAP systems hosted on RISE. For more information, see [Integrating the Service with Microsoft Entra ID](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/integrating-service-with-microsoft-azure-ad).
- For applications that access SAP, use [principal propagation to establish SSO](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/SAP/blob/master/sap-oauth-saml-flow/README.md).

- If you're using SAP BTP services or SaaS solutions that require SAP Cloud Identity Service, Identity Authentication (IAS), [implement SSO between SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Services and Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/scenario-azure-first-sap-identity-integration) to access those SAP services. This integration lets SAP IAS act as a proxy identity provider and forwards authentication requests to Microsoft Entra ID as the central user store and identity provider.

- If you're using SAP SuccessFactors, use Microsoft Entra ID [automated user provisioning](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-cloud-only-tutorial). With this integration, as you add new employees to SAP SuccessFactors, you can automatically create their user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID. Optionally, you can create user accounts in Microsoft 365 or other SaaS applications that are supported by Microsoft Entra ID. Use write-back of the email address to SAP SuccessFactors.
