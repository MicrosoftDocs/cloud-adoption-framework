# Introduction to hybrid and multicloud

[Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/) provides a comprehensive portfolio of cloud services to help you build and operate technology solutions in the cloud. Sound business reasons can drive the necessity of using multiple private and public clouds. This article outlines and expands on Microsoft's perspective on important cloud computing terms to help you start your hybrid and multicloud journey.

## Define hybrid and multicloud concepts

Clear definitions of hybrid and multicloud concepts help organizations understand deployment options and make informed architectural decisions. This understanding is essential because these deployment models significantly impact your cloud adoption strategy, operational complexity, and business outcomes. You must establish a common vocabulary for hybrid and multicloud concepts to ensure effective communication across teams and stakeholders.

1. **Understand hybrid cloud.** A [hybrid cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-azure-hybrid-services/2-hybrid-cloud-overview) combines a private cloud (on-premises infrastructure) with a public cloud (computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet). Hybrid cloud architectures can enable integration or movement of selected data and applications between environments when you design them with consistent identity, networking, data replication, and management controls. Organizations choose this deployment model because of business requirements such as meeting [regulatory and data sovereignty requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/), maximizing on-premises technology investments, or addressing latency constraints.

2. **Understand edge workloads.** The hybrid cloud includes edge workloads that extend computing capabilities closer to data sources and users. Cloud-managed edge capabilities such as [Azure Stack Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-overview), [Azure Stack HCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/overview), and [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview) extend selected Azure management, data, and application services closer to where IoT devices and data sources reside. Placing workloads at the edge reduces latency because devices spend less time communicating with distant services and can operate reliably during extended offline periods. This expanded compute, storage, and service availability provides experience-driven resources closer to customers.

3. **Understand multicloud.** [Multicloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/) computing uses multiple cloud computing services from more than one cloud provider (including private and public clouds) in a heterogeneous environment. A multicloud strategy can increase deployment flexibility and reduce single-provider dependency risks while introducing additional governance, integration, cost management, and skills complexity that you must address. Organizations choose services from different cloud providers that are best suited for a specific task or to take advantage of services offered in a specific geographic location.

## Build a comprehensive hybrid and multicloud strategy

A comprehensive strategy addresses the complexities of managing workloads across multiple environments while maximizing business value. This strategy is important because organizations need to balance flexibility, control, and operational efficiency across different cloud and on-premises environments. You must develop a strategic approach that aligns with your business objectives and technical requirements.

1. **Use Azure services to enable unified governance and security.** A hybrid cloud platform can provide flexibility, centralized control, and scalable deployment options with integrated security and governance when you use services such as [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview), [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview), [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction), and [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview). These services are important because they provide consistent management capabilities across environments and reduce operational complexity. Using unified governance helps organizations extend the lifecycle value of existing infrastructure when accompanied by mature governance and capacity management practices.

2. **Design for elastic scaling while protecting sensitive data.** When computing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud architectures can let you burst selected workloads into the public cloud to handle demand spikes, without exposing all sensitive data to third-party datacenters. This capability is important because it provides cost-effective scaling without compromising data security requirements. By running suitable workloads in the cloud, your organization gains the flexibility and innovation cloud services provide while retaining highly sensitive data in your own datacenter to satisfy client needs or regulatory requirements.

3. **Implement cost-effective scaling and modernization approaches.** This architectural approach lets you scale computing resources while modernizing and protecting [mission-critical applications and data](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/business-critical-applications/). Cost-effective scaling is important because it reduces the need for large capital expenditures to meet short-term demand spikes. With consumption-based billing models, your organization pays for the resources it temporarily uses instead of purchasing and maintaining additional hardware that could remain idle.

4. **Use cloud-based backup and disaster recovery to optimize costs.** Cloud-based backup and disaster recovery (BCDR) can shift costs from capital expenditures to operational expenditures by using services such as [Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-overview) and [Azure Site Recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) for workloads and data that aren't restricted from residing in a public cloud. These services are important because they take advantage of investments in security, compliance, scalability, and recovery automation while reducing infrastructure management overhead.

## Address common customer requirements

Organizations commonly express specific requirements when adopting hybrid and multicloud approaches. Understanding these requirements is important because they drive architectural decisions and technology choices that impact long-term success. You must evaluate and address each requirement systematically to ensure your hybrid and multicloud implementation meets business needs.

1. **Implement unified visibility across all environments.** Customers need visibility into the health of all existing and future infrastructure and applications in a single pane of glass. This visibility is important because distributed environments can create operational blind spots that increase risk and reduce efficiency. Use services like [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview) and [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview) to provide centralized monitoring and management across environments.

2. **Establish unified governance standards.** Organizations need integration of on-premises policies and updates with cloud infrastructure, demonstrating the need for a unified governance standard. Unified governance is important because inconsistent policies across environments can create security gaps and compliance risks. Implement [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview) to enforce consistent governance across hybrid and multicloud environments.

3. **Enable consistent development practices.** Development teams need consistent interoperability between on-premises and cloud environments so they can unify practices. Consistent practices are important because they reduce training overhead, improve deployment reliability, and accelerate development cycles. Use [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) and Arc-enabled application services to provide consistent development and deployment experiences.

4. **Manage security posture without operational disruption.** Organizations need to manage security posture without heavily modifying current operations across heterogeneous environments. Seamless security management is important because operational disruption can reduce productivity and create security vulnerabilities during transitions. Implement [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) to provide unified security management across environments.

## Support specialized deployment scenarios

Hybrid and multicloud deployments often support specialized scenarios that require specific considerations. These scenarios are important because they address legitimate business needs that pure cloud adoption cannot satisfy. You must understand when and how to implement hybrid solutions for specialized requirements.

1. **Support highly regulated industries with data residency requirements.** A hybrid strategy supports customer operations that preclude the use of the public cloud for some workloads such as government, healthcare, and financial services. Data residency requirements are important because regulatory compliance often mandates that certain data types remain within specific geographic boundaries. Depending on geography and data sovereignty regulations, internal and customer data can be required to remain within on-premises datacenters.

2. **Address latency-sensitive applications and connectivity constraints.** Latency-sensitive data requires compute close to data sources, and potential internet connectivity disruptions have critical implications for business operations. Edge computing is important because it enables real-time processing and reduces dependency on network connectivity. In these scenarios, hybrid solutions can deploy a subset of Azure services through Azure Arc-enabled services or Azure Stack portfolio solutions (including [Azure Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/overview) and [Azure Stack Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-overview)) on-premises with centralized management and, where supported, consumption-based billing models.

## Understand business motivations for hybrid and multicloud adoption

Clear business motivations help organizations make informed decisions about hybrid and multicloud adoption. Understanding these motivations is important because they guide investment priorities and architectural choices that align with business objectives. You must evaluate each motivation against your specific business context and technical requirements.

1. **Evaluate provider diversity strategies carefully.** Common business drivers include minimizing or avoiding single cloud provider lock-in (balanced against the efficiency benefits of deeper platform integration), existing adoption of different cloud platforms across business units, subsidiaries, or acquired companies, and regulatory and data sovereignty requirements across different geopolitical regions (see [compliance offerings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/)). Provider diversity is important because it can reduce dependency risks, but you must balance this approach against the complexity it introduces.

2. **Plan for business continuity and performance optimization.** Organizations adopt hybrid and multicloud strategies to improve business continuity and disaster recovery by duplicating selected workloads across providers (see [Azure Site Recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview)), maximize performance by running applications close to user locations (see [Azure global infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/)), and enable migration of certain data platforms or industry solutions by adopting targeted multicloud strategies (supported by [Azure Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview)). Performance and continuity planning are important because they directly impact user experience and business operations.

## Address hybrid and multicloud concerns proactively

Organizations must understand and address potential concerns with hybrid and multicloud adoption before implementation. Addressing these concerns proactively is important because unresolved issues can lead to increased costs, operational complexity, and security risks. You must plan for both the benefits and challenges of hybrid and multicloud adoption.

1. **Balance portability requirements with platform value.** Some motivations can translate into measurable business transformation with a sound hybrid and multicloud adoption strategy, while others require significant pre-deployment and post-deployment effort. Portability planning is important because aggressively avoiding all platform-specific capabilities can limit the value realized from cloud adoption. Many of the most beneficial platform services are not fully portable across providers. To improve portability and minimize lock-in risk, organizations often standardize on portable abstractions such as containers and Kubernetes while recognizing the trade-off: broader platform service adoption can accelerate delivery and operations but increases coupling. Review [compute decision guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree) for trade-offs.

2. **Plan for operational complexity across heterogeneous environments.** After workloads reach production, operations management across heterogeneous environments can require rethinking established practices. Operational planning is important because existing operations platforms, policies, and processes might not support distributed hybrid, multicloud, and edge scenarios. Without a unifying control plane, divergent tooling and practices can multiply operational cost and risk. Implement [unified operations](./unified-operations.md) with [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview) to standardize governance, security posture management, and observability across environments.

## Implement unified operations to minimize concerns

Unified operations provide a foundation for successful hybrid and multicloud adoption by establishing consistent management practices across environments. Understanding unified operations is important because it can address many common concerns regarding hybrid and multicloud strategies. You must evaluate your operational approach before proceeding with hybrid and multicloud adoption at scale.

1. **Establish a unified operations strategy before scaling.** Consistent operations practices across cloud environments with a common control plane can address many hybrid and multicloud concerns. A unified approach is important because it reduces operational complexity and ensures consistent governance across environments. Review whether you need to duplicate operations for each cloud provider or implement a [unified operations approach to cloud management](./unified-operations.md) (built on [Azure Resource Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) and Azure Arc) before proceeding with hybrid and multicloud adoption at scale.
