# Define a strategy for hybrid and multicloud operations

Hybrid cloud refers to a mix of on-premises/private infrastructure and public cloud services working together, while multicloud means using multiple cloud providers concurrently. Many enterprises today have siloed teams, distributed sites, and systems spread across on-prem datacenters and various clouds. The challenge is to unify these environments in a secure, well-managed way that enables modernization from cloud to edge. This guidance provides a prescriptive end-to-end framework for unifying and managing hybrid and multicloud environments with Azure as the central control plane.

We explain how Azure solutions, like Azure Arc, Azure Monitor, Azure Kubernetes Service, Microsoft Fabric, Azure IoT, and Azure Local, help consolidate control and modernize IT across all environments, while maintaining security and compliance. The goal is to establish a standard operational model that breaks down silos and delivers consistent practices everywhere. We’ll detail how to secure, manage, and modernize resources from cloud to edge, unifying previously isolated teams and systems under one Azure-driven strategy.

## Establish Azure as your unified control plane

The first step is to establish a clear strategy for hybrid and multicloud that aligns with your business goals and emphasizes unification. This ensures your cloud adoption is driven by business value (agility, resilience, cost optimization, innovation) rather than ad-hoc decisions. Key activities in this phase include defining drivers and vision, setting guiding principles, determining your cloud mix, and mapping Azure services to objectives.

## Define business drivers for hybrid and multicloud adoption

Start by identifying why your organization is adopting hybrid and multicloud. Business drivers provide focus and ensure the approach delivers measurable value. These drivers must link to concrete business outcomes or KPIs to guide decisions and prevent fragmented technology choices. Common drivers include:

- **Vendor flexibility**: Reduce dependence on any single provider to mitigate lock-in and allow cost optimization and best-of-breed service use. For example, avoid relying solely on one cloud’s features if an alternative could save cost or offer unique capabilities.
- **Business unit diversity**: Accommodate different teams, acquisitions, or subsidiaries that use various platforms. A unified strategy prevents operational silos and establishes central governance across all environments while respecting existing investments.
- **Compliance and data residency**: Meet regulatory mandates for data sovereignty or specific security controls. For instance, use Azure Local for sensitive workloads that must remain on-premises, while connecting to Azure cloud services for other data and applications.
- **Resilience and disaster recovery**: Improve availability by distributing workloads and establishing multi-environment failover. Design seamless recovery between Azure and secondary environments (other clouds or on-prem) with unified processes to ensure minimal downtime.
- **Performance optimization**: Place workloads closer to users or data sources to reduce latency. For example, deploy Azure Local instances in factory locations for real-time processing, while maintaining centralized coordination through Azure cloud services.
- **Modernization and innovation**: Use specialized cloud services to drive transformation. For example, use Azure’s AI services and Microsoft Fabric analytics while integrating data and apps across other clouds as needed.
- **Unifying silos**: Eliminate internal silos between infrastructure, cloud, and application teams. Establish common tools and processes, like Azure Arc for resource management, Azure Monitor for observability, to create shared visibility and collaboration across formerly isolated groups.

For each business driver, link it to a specific business outcome or KPI. For example, if a driver is “avoid downtime,” an outcome could be achieving 99.99% availability. If “support global expansion” is a driver, an outcome might be launching in a certain number of new countries within a year. If unifying silos is a goal, an outcome could be 20% reduction in operational overhead by unifying IT processes. Grounding drivers in outcomes ensures the strategy focuses on delivering measurable value. Document these drivers and desired outcomes clearly, as they will steer all subsequent decisions.

## Create a clear vision statement and establish success metrics

Craft a concise vision statement that describes the target state of your hybrid/multicloud environment and what success looks like. This provides direction and helps all stakeholders understand the end goal. The vision should articulate how the unified approach benefits the organization. For example:

- “Build an adaptive cloud platform that unifies all infrastructure and teams, enabling any app to run where it best meets business needs.” (Emphasizes flexibility and unity.)
- “Deliver consistent customer experiences with 100% uptime through multi-cloud resilience.” (Focuses on reliability and continuity.)
- “Increase deployment frequency by 50% by standardizing DevOps across cloud and on-premises.” (Focuses on agility and process improvement.)
- “Reduce on-premises footprint by 50% in two years to cut costs, while extending cloud management to all remaining on-prem assets.” (Emphasizes efficiency and cloud-first operations.)

Alongside the vision, define 2–5 key success metrics (KPIs) to measure progress. Each major driver from the previous step should map to at least one KPI. Make them specific and time-bound where possible. For example: if agility is a driver, a KPI might be “Provisioning time for infrastructure reduced from weeks to hours across all environments within 12 months.” If cost optimization is a driver, a KPI might be “Improve infrastructure utilization by 30% through cloud bursting and consolidation.” Include a security or compliance metric as well, such as “100% of resources across clouds compliant with baseline security policies measured via Azure Policy and Defender for Cloud.”

By setting a clear vision and metrics, you create a shared definition of success. This will align teams and provide a way to track the impact of your hybrid/multicloud initiative over time.

## Set principles for cloud choice

Establish guiding principles for deciding which cloud or environment to use for different workloads. Clear principles prevent random or preference-driven choices that could increase complexity. They also balance the desire for portability against the benefits of cloud-specific services. Develop guidelines such as:

1. **Determine cloud-neutral versus cloud-specific usage.** Determine where you will build cloud-agnostic solutions versus using cloud-native services. For each workload, decide if portability is critical. For example, for core systems of record you might prioritize neutrality, using technologies like containers, Kubernetes, or databases that run anywhere. In contrast, for customer-facing or innovation projects, you might use cloud-specific PaaS services, like Azure Cosmos DB or Azure AI services, to accelerate development.

2. **Use Azure as a unifying layer where possible.** Since we are focusing on Microsoft’s solutions, make Azure the central management and integration layer for all environments. Rather than maintaining parallel toolsets for each cloud, plan to manage other clouds through Azure, using Azure Arc. This way, even if workloads run in AWS or GCP, your operations and security remain centralized on Azure. For example, you might run some VMs on AWS, but onboard them to Azure via Arc and enforce policies through Azure, so your team manages them just like Azure resources. This principle ensures that you’re not “locked in” to each cloud’s management tools. Azure becomes the consistent overlay.

3. **Justify multicloud complexity.** A multicloud approach can introduce complexity, such as multiple skill sets, varying architectures, and potentially higher costs like data egress charges between clouds. Set a principle that using an additional cloud must have a clear justification. For instance: “Default to Azure for new deployments unless a unique capability or business requirement mandates otherwise. If a secondary cloud is used, integrate it through Azure and revisit its necessity periodically.” This intentional stance avoids a sprawl of unmanaged, siloed deployments on different platforms. In practice, it means if a developer proposes using a different data analytics technology, they must have a strong reason and plan to integrate it, such as via Azure data services for governance. Otherwise, they should use Azure’s analytics offerings like Microsoft
Fabric.

These principles provide architects and engineers with a decision framework. For example, when choosing a database service, the guidelines might steer them to an open-source database on an Azure VM for portability or to Azure’s PaaS database for functionality, rather than automatically picking a non-Azure service that doesn’t align with strategy. The overall aim is to encourage use of Azure as the backbone, minimize fragmentation, and only embrace multicloud elements when required.

## Select your cloud mix and designate Azure as your primary hub

Decide which cloud platforms including on-premises will be part of your strategy, and establish Azure as the central management hub from the start:

1. **Choose your cloud portfolio based on requirements.** Evaluate business and technical needs to decide the mix of cloud platforms. Many enterprises use multiple public clouds to satisfy different needs or legacy investments. Document which platforms you will use and why. Also determine what role on-premises infrastructure will play going forward. For example, you might use Azure for the majority of workloads and maintain on-prem systems for certain factory control systems using Azure Local. Be specific. Identify any critical workloads that must remain on-prem and plan to modernize them with Azure Local or Arc, and any exceptional cases for other clouds. Ensure this planned mix ties back to your drivers, such as using a secondary cloud for resilience or specialized capabilities.

2. **Make Azure your primary control plane for all environments.** Clearly state that Azure will serve as the main hub for managing resources across all clouds and on-prem. This is a key strategic decision because Azure offers strong hybrid management via Azure Arc and related services. By projecting AWS, Google Cloud, and on-prem resources into Azure for management, you centralize expertise and tooling. For example, use Azure as the single pane of glass for management and monitoring for your entire infrastructure. This means you will prefer managing AWS resources from Azure (Arc) rather than managing Azure resources from AWS tools. Azure’s cross-cloud capabilities (Arc, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor) make it well-suited for this hub role, providing a degree of integration and consistency you won’t get if you try the reverse.

3. **Design your unified operating model.** Envision how IT operations will function in this hybrid/multicloud setup. Define processes that work across all environments. For instance: “All servers (Azure VMs, on-prem servers, AWS EC2) will be inventoried and configured via Azure Arc and Azure Policy. CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps will deploy applications to any target environment using approved templates. Our network operations will treat Azure as the hub linking other sites/clouds, and our security team will use Microsoft Sentinel to watch everything.” By describing this target operating model, you set expectations that silos, like separate ops teams for each cloud, will be replaced with unified operations. It prepares the organization for changes in day-to-day work and clarifies how consistency will be achieved.

4. **Establish unified teams to support cross-platform operations.** Alongside technology, plan the human aspect. Declare intentions such as: “We will establish enabling teams that include members from traditional IT, cloud teams, and security, to govern all cloud usage. We will train our on-prem IT staff in Azure and cloud skills so they can manage resources in any environment via Azure’s tools.” This signals that you expect collaboration and cross-training. In some cases, it might mean reorganizing: maybe merging separate cloud teams, or having centralized platform engineering that serves all business units. Making this part of the strategy ensures the operational model is supported by the org structure.

## Map Azure services to strategic objectives

As you finalize the strategy, identify which Azure services and technologies will help achieve your specific goals. This creates a bridge from high-level strategy to actionable implementation. Consider all key areas of your tech stack and map them to Azure solutions:

| Technology Area            | Azure Solution                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hybrid & multicloud management | **Azure Arc** – Project all infrastructure (servers, clusters, databases) into Azure for a unified control plane. This enables central management and policy enforcement across on-prem and other clouds. |
| Identity & access management  | **Microsoft Entra ID** – Use it as the unified identity platform across all environments via synchronization or federation. This provides single sign-on and unified credential management for Azure, on-prem AD, AWS, Google Cloud, and SaaS apps. |
| Observability & monitoring    | **Azure Monitor** – Consolidate logs, metrics, and traces from every environment into Azure Monitor. Use Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Monitor agents/Arc to ingest data from on-prem and other clouds. Complement with Azure Automation/Automanage for routine ops (backup, patching) tasks across resources. |
| Container orchestration       | **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** – Standardize on AKS for containerized workloads. Use AKS in Azure and AKS on Azure Local (or Arc-enabled K8s on other infra) so that Kubernetes clusters everywhere are managed consistently. Also consider Azure Container Apps for serverless containers where appropriate. |
| Data & analytics              | **Microsoft Fabric** – Create a unified analytics layer across the enterprise. Fabric can connect to on-prem SQL databases, Azure Data Lakes, and even third-party cloud data sources to provide one integrated data estate for BI and AI. (Also use Azure Data Factory or Synapse pipelines to move or sync data as needed.) |
| IoT & edge computing          | **Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Edge** – Manage IoT devices and edge processing using Azure IoT services. Integrate IoT deployments with Azure Arc (via IoT Operations) to apply the same governance and security. This ensures IoT devices and edge compute (in factories, retail sites) are part of your unified cloud management rather than stand-alone. |
| On-premises infrastructure    | **Azure Local** – For any new on-prem hardware investment or private cloud needs, use Azure Local (Azure Stack HCI) to ensure it seamlessly integrates with Azure services. Azure Local allows running VMs and even Azure services on-prem, enabled by Azure Arc for unified management. |
| Security & compliance         | **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** – Use this for unified Cloud Security Posture Management and threat protection across Azure, AWS, and GCP resources. It identifies misconfigurations and threats in any cloud. Combine with Azure Policy (extended via Arc) to enforce governance rules on Arc-enabled servers, Kubernetes clusters, and data services everywhere. Also consider Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM across logs from all environments. |

Documenting this mapping ensures your strategy includes a concrete Azure-centric technology game plan. It also helps in identifying skill gaps and tooling needs early. For example, if you plan to use Microsoft Fabric for analytics, you know you’ll need data integration skills and Power BI expertise. If Azure Arc is central (which it is), you’ll plan training for your ops teams on Arc. This step translates your strategic intentions into actionable Azure services that will make it happen.

## Outcome

At the end of Step 1, produce a Hybrid/Multicloud Strategy Brief that captures all the above elements. It should summarize your decisions so far:

- **Business drivers & scope**: Unify IT operations, uptime requirements for multicloud, edge requirements.
- **Vision statement**: Azure is the primary platform and control plane, integrating other clouds and on-prem systems to provide a unified, agile digital infrastructure.
- **Success metrics**: Specific targets for availability, deployment speed, cost savings, and compliance.
- **Guiding principles**: Stances on avoiding lock-in, defaulting to Azure, using cloud-neutral designs where needed.
- **Cloud mix**: Which environments will be used (Azure, on-prem via Azure Local, and minimal use of others with Azure as hub) and why.
- **Key technologies**: The Azure and any non-Azure services decided upon to execute the strategy.

To illustrate, here’s an example excerpt of how a strategy might be summarized:

- Example Strategy Summary: “The organization will pursue an adaptive hybrid/multicloud approach to unify IT operations while using the best cloud capabilities for each need.”
- **Drivers**: Avoid downtime (target < 1 hour/year); meet EU data residency laws; break down ops silos to improve efficiency (target 20% OPEX reduction).
- **Vision**: Azure is our primary cloud and control plane integrating all other environments. We will improve global coverage using Azure plus one secondary cloud and Azure Local for on-prem needs.
- **Cloud principles**: Design core systems to be cloud-agnostic (containerized, portable databases) where necessary, but embrace Azure-native services for differentiation and speed. Default new deployments to Azure unless a compelling requirement dictates otherwise.
- **Cloud mix**: Currently ~50% on-prem to be modernized with Azure Local, 40% Azure, 10% AWS for a specific use case. Long-term aim: 70% Azure, with remaining on-prem running via Azure Local and only niche use of other clouds.
- **Key Azure technologies**: Azure Arc to unify resource management. Azure Monitor and Defender for end-to-end visibility and security;.Azure Local to extend cloud to on-prem. AKS for containers. Microsoft Fabric to unify data analytics. Azure IoT for edge devices. Entra ID for unified identity. Standardized DevOps pipelines for all deployments. Success will be measured by our ability to meet uptime and deployment frequency targets while maintaining strict security compliance across all platforms.
