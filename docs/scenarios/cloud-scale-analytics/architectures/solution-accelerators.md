# Solution Accelerators

**Solution Accelerators** are open-source projects hosted on GitHub holding repositories of resources and information that simplify and accelerate problem solving through the implementation of technology. We produce solution accelerators by identifying and developing best practices and other IP from real-world engagements with customers. We test each solution with our Field & Partners and fine-tune them prior to General Availability (GA).

In data mesh, each solution accelerator is a data product. One might be a recommendation engine, or a demand forecasting solution. Each solution accelerator is an end-to-end solution that contains code, notebook, and pipeline. Customers can use solution accelerators to quickly build data products and realize data's value.
