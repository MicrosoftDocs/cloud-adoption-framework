# Enterprise enrollment

Azure landing zones for cloud-scale analytics don't have any considerations or recommendations that affect enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions.

However, it's important to understand the decisions made by the cloud platform team, and to be aware of existing [enterprise enrollment or Microsoft Entra tenant decisions](../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-microsoft-entra-tenant.md).

## Identity and access management

Review [identity and access management considerations](./eslz-identity-and-access-management.md). These considerations can help you understand how the Microsoft Entra tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You can also evaluate the [resource organization considerations](./eslz-resource-organization.md) to understand how the enrollment might be organized into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
