# Clean-up instructions

As you go through the tutorial, you might run into deployment issues, to start over fresh, please use the steps below to remove the resources created in your subscription.

Also, once all the steps in the tutorial are completed, you can use the  scripts below to remove all resources that have been created in your subscription.

>[!Warning]
>Please ensure you selected the correct prefix as a filter. The filter parameter will be used to remove the resource groups created during the Workshop Labs. Removing resource groups with this scripts is a irreversible operation.

```powershell

$prefix = '<your prefix>'
$subscriptionId = '<subscription ID>'

# Set Subscription
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

# Lists all Resource Groups that will be removed
Get-AzResourceGroup | ? ResourceGroupName -match $prefix | Select-Object ResourceGroupName

# Removes the list of Resource Groups shown in the previous command
Get-AzResourceGroup | ? ResourceGroupName -match $prefix | Remove-AzResourceGroup -AsJob -Force

```

```bash
# Cloud Shell, MacOS and Linux bash script with az cli 

prefix='<prefix>'  
subscription='<subscription ID>'

# Set Subscription
az account set --subscription $subscription

# Visual Review to ensure the resource groups matches with specified prefix. 
az group list -o tsv  --query "[?contains(@.name, '$prefix')==\`true\`].name"

# Delete Resource Groups that matches with prefix. 
for rg in $(az group list -o tsv --query "[?contains(@.name, '$prefix')==\`true\`].name"); 
do 
    az group delete --name $rg -y --no-wait; 
done
```

```powershell
