# Deploy Data Product Batch via One Click Deployment

 If you want to experiment with the resources and see what gets deployed as part of Data Product Batch deployment, use the **Deploy to Azure Button** to deploy resources for the Data Product Batch in a Data Landing Zone. The applicable scenarios for Data Product Batch includes Data Product and Data Integration. As Explained earlier, Data Products are another unit of scale inside a Data Landing Zone. In addition to Data Product, this template can be used for Data Integration into the platform.

To deploy the Data Product Batch using the One Click method, follow these steps below:

1. Click on the Deploy to Azure button below. This opens a new page in the Azure portal as depicted on the image below this table:

      | Reference implementation   | Description | Deploy to Azure |
      |:---------------------------|:------------|:----------------|
      | Data Product Batch     | Deploys a Data Workload template for Data Batch Analysis to a resource group inside a Data Landing Zone. Please make sure you deploy a [Data Management Landing Zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone) and [Data Landing Zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-landing-zone) first. |[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-product-batch%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-product-batch%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fportal.dataProduct.json) |

1. In the **Data Product** tab, provide the following information:

      | Setting| Suggested Value(s)  |
      |:-------|:--------------------|
      | SubscriptionÂ | Select the subscription to deploy the Data Product to. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, please choose the correct one. |
      | Resource Group | Type "dev-dp001" on the dropdown and select the resource group that has the DLZ prefix you created earlier plus the "-dev-dp001" suffix. |  
      | Location | Select from the dropdown. If there are no organizational policies influencing the location, it is a good idea to pick a region that is physically close to you. Please verify that this region is supported for Enterprise Scale Analytics. A list of supported regions are available [here](/lab1/0_data_management_landing_zone_overview/) and navigate to "Supported Regions". |
      | Environment | We recommend you choose Development, as this is a tutorial. You could use the same process to deploy a Test or Production environment as well. |
      | Data Product Name | This is a prefix added to all the deployed data product resources to make them unique within the subscription. This can be a max of 10 alphanumeric characters. |
