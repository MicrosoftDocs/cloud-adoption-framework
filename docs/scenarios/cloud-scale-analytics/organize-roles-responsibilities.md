# Roles and Responsibilities

After you've defined your cloud-scale analytics strategy, you need to organize teams to successfully deliver on it. This article describes some of the roles and responsibilities you should consider for cloud-scale analytics. You can map these roles and responsibilities to the various teams we've discussed in previous articles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article highlights potential roles and responsibilities, but it isn't an complete list. Consider this article's guidance and then alter it for what works within your organization. If you're a small organization, you might not resource these roles, but that shouldn't prevent you from deploying a cloud-scale analytics platform. If you're a large organization, you might decide to streamline and consolidate roles.

## Roles

A cloud-scale analytics deployment involves multiple roles. The following table describes each role, job title, and responsibilities.

| Role | Other Job Title | Responsibilities | Skills | Applies to: |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
