# Data governance overview

Breaking down structured data into data entities and data subject areas is the key to successful data governance. You can then use a data governance solution to surround your specific data entities and data subject areas with people, processes, policies, and technology. This solution helps your data entities' lifecycle governance. Establishing a common business vocabulary in a business glossary within your data catalog can also help you govern your data.

Your data catalog is critical technology. You can't govern your data if you don't know where it is or what it means. Data catalog software provides automatic data discovery, automatic profiling that determines data quality, and automatic sensitive data detection. It also helps you map disparate data to your common vocabulary data names and definitions in your catalog's business glossary to understand what the data means.

Data classification is a method of categorizing data assets by assigning them unique logical labels or classes. Classification is based on the data's business context. Some classification labels or classes you might use include:

- Passport number
- Driver's license number
- Credit card number
- SWIFT code
- Individual's name

Data classification schemes such as the examples shown in [data confidentiality classification scheme](./govern-requirements.md#data-confidentiality-classification-scheme). This schema must be defined in your data catalog. At this point, you can create policies and rules in your catalog associated with different levels of classification.

Create a [data lifecycle retention classification scheme](govern-requirements.md#data-lifecycle-retention-classification-scheme) to provide different levels of retention classification for your data lifecycle management. You can have a custom microservice lifecycle application use this scheme to maintain data's lifecycle within your environment.

Specify how to govern data attributes in your business glossary by labeling (or tagging) them with confidentiality and retention classification. Your data catalog already knows the mappings of physical data attributes in different data stores to business glossary attributes. Labeling an attribute in your glossary automatically determines how the data mapped to it in underlying data stores should be governed. Multiple technologies integrated with your data catalog can enforce policies and rules across all data stores in your distributed data landscape by accessing this metadata. You can also apply these same classification labels to unstructured data.

Master data entities are critical because their data is so widely shared. Master data entities are frequently associated with documents. Customer and invoice, supplier and contract, and asset and operating manual are all examples of a master data entity and document pairing. This type of connection allows you to tag related documents using master data values (such as a supplier name) and ensure that relationships between structured and unstructured data are preserved.

You can create pipelines that create trusted data assets by using the common vocabulary data entities you defined in your data catalog. You can then publish these assets in a data marketplace for all to share. 

The key takeaway here about data governance is that you can use available methods to get your data under control, and once your data is trusted, you can use it to drive value. How well you organize and collaborate to achieve data governance determines your level of success.
