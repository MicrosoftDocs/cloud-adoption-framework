These templates contain Azure Resource Manager templates, the templates' parameter files, and CI/CD pipeline definitions for resource deployment.

Templates can change over time due to new Azure services and requirements. Secure each repository's main branch so it remains error-free and ready for consumption and deployment. Use a development subscription to test template configuration changes before you merge feature enhancements back into your main branch.
