## Data quality solutions

As of February 2022, Microsoft depends on partners, open-source solutions, and custom solutions to provide a data quality solution. You're encouraged to assess partners, such as Informatica, Talend, CluedIn and Ataccama One.

For open-source solutions, businesses have implemented the Great Expectations tool into their data pipelines.
