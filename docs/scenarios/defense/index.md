# Introduction to the defense scenario

The CAF Defense scenario is cloud adoption guidance tailored for defense organizations. Defense organizations coordinate and supervise armed forces in the interest of national security. Data must be current, secure, and available from the tactical edge to headquarters distributed around the globe. The defense scenario addresses the challenges mission owners face in cloud adoption and offers recommendations to navigate those challenges. The goal is to help accelerate the digital transformation efforts of defense organizations.

The defense scenario is divided into three domains: command, platform, and mission. It will be helpful to outline each domain:

Strategy, plan, and organize are in the command domain. Ready and govern are in the platform domain. Adopt, secure, and manage are in the mission domain." lightbox="./images/defense-scenario.png" border="false":::

## Command domain

The command domain focuses on preparing defense organizations for cloud adoption so that they can achieve their objectives. Here mission owners identify goals and motivators and define a roadmap to achieve those identified goals. They also involve the right people to develop, execute, and maintain the cloud solution.

## Platform domain

The platform domain focuses on establishing a foundation for Mission applications and services to run in the cloud. The high priority in this domain is aligning with a cloud broker approach. The preferred way to build a cloud platform is with a cloud broker. A cloud broker builds and maintains the platform while establishing connectivity, identity, and governance for the platform. The platform domain provides guidance on how to prepare and execute with a cloud broker.

## Mission domain

The mission domain focuses on the iterative process of developing cloud solutions. The domain covers technology adoption and how to use those technologies to secure and manage defense workloads. Whether migrating or rearchitecting an application using cloud native services, architectural decisions need to be made that align with mission objectives, and the workload domain provides guidance in this area.

## Next step

The defense scenario helps ensure defense organizations reach the objective in each domain of your cloud adoption journey. The command domain is the starting point of the defense scenario. It starts with building a strategy to meet broader defense initiatives.
