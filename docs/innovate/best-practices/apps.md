# Tools to engage via apps in Azure

As described in [Engage via apps](../considerations/apps.md), applications can be an important aspect of an MVP solution. Applications are often required for testing a hypothesis. This article helps you learn the tools Azure provides to accelerate development of those applications.

## Alignment to the methodology

You can accelerate this type of digital invention through each of the following listed approaches. The preceding image also shows these approaches. Technical guidance for accelerating digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left side of this page. Those articles are grouped by their approaches to aligning guidance with the overall methodology.

For this article, assume all inventions that result in an application stem from a shared solution as described in [empower adoption](./ci-cd.md). Also assume each application results in some type of customer experience for both internal and external customers.

Based on these assumptions, the following three paths are the most common for cloud adoption teams who are developing digital inventions:

- **Citizen developers:** Before engaging professional developers, business subject matter experts use citizen developer tools. These tools rapidly test and validate that a customer hypothesis can meet the needs of that customer.
- **Intelligent experiences:** Create modern experiences by using cloud platforms to drive rapid deployment and short feedback loops. Expand on web applications to infuse intelligence or even integrate bots.
- **Cloud-native:** Build a new invention that naturally takes advantage of cloud capabilities.

Each path results in advantages and disadvantages that are both short-term and long-term. When the cloud governance team, the cloud operations team, and and the cloud center of excellence team are ready to support every approach, you can accelerate adoption with minimal effect on sustainable business operations.

## Toolchain

Depending on the path that the cloud adoption team takes, Azure provides tools to accelerate the team's ability to build with customer empathy. The following list of Azure offerings is grouped based on the preceding decision paths. These offerings include:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Migrate
- Azure Stack
- PowerApps
- Microsoft Flow
- Power BI

## Get started

The table of contents on the left side of this page outlines many articles. These articles help you get started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
