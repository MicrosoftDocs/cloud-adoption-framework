# Tools to predict and influence data in Azure

As described in the conceptual article on [predict and influence](../considerations/predict.md), computers and AI are much better than we are at seeing patterns. By using cloud-based analytics tools, you can easily detect patterns and apply them to your customers' needs. Use of these tools results in predictions of the best outcomes. When those predictions are integrated back into customer experiences, they can influence your customers' behavior patterns through interactions.

## Alignment to the methodology

You can accelerate this type of digital invention through each phase of the following process. The phases align with the methodology shown in the preceding image. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left side of this page. Those articles are grouped by phase to align with the methodology.

In the preceding image, data and insights align with the best practices outlined in the [democratizing data](./data.md) article. As subject matter experts discover insights that might be repeatable, they can use the following three steps to mature those insights:

- **Patterns:** Find and define patterns to create predictive models.
- **Predictions:** Apply patterns to customer data to predict outcomes based on the model and underlying pattern.
- **Interactions:** Consume the predictions from within an application or data source to drive an interaction with your customer.

## Toolchain

In Azure, the following tools are commonly used to accelerate digital invention across each of the preceding phases:

- Azure Machine Learning
- Azure HDInsight
- Hadoop R ScaleR
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse

How each tool helps with each phase of predict and influence is reflected in the guidance in the table of contents on the left side of this page.

## Get started

The table of contents on the left side of this page outlines many articles. These articles help you get started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
