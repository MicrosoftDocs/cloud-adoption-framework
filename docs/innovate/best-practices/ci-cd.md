# Tools to empower adoption in Azure

As described in [Empower adoption](../considerations/ci-cd.md), building true innovation at scale requires an investment in removing friction that could slow adoption. In the early stages of testing a hypothesis, a solution is small. The investment in removing friction is likely small as well. As hypotheses prove true, the solution and the investment in empowering adoption grows. This article provides key continuous integration links to help you get started with each stage of the maturity model.

## Alignment with the Innovate methodology

You can accelerate this type of digital invention through the following maturity levels. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left side of this page. Those articles are grouped by maturity model level.

- **Shared solution:** Establish a centralized repository for all aspects of the solution.
- **Feedback loops:** Ensure feedback loops can be managed consistently throughout iterations.
- **Continuous integration:** Regularly build and consolidate a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) solution.
- **Reliable testing:** Validate solution quality and expected changes to drive ensuring measurements.
- **Solution deployment:** Deploy a solution to allow a team to share changes with customers quickly.
- **Integrated measurement:** Add learning metrics to the feedback loop for clear analysis by the entire team.

## Toolchain

For adoption teams that are mature professional development teams with many contributors, the Azure toolchain starts with GitHub and Azure DevOps.

You can expand this foundation to use other tool features as your need grows. The expanded foundation might involve tools like:

- Azure Blueprints
- Azure Policy
- Azure Resource Manager templates
- Azure Monitor

The table of contents on the left side of this page lists guidance for each tool and aligns with the previously described maturity model.

## Get started

Below you'll find articles to help you get started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
