# Machine learning

Azure empowers you with the most advanced machine learning capabilities. Quickly and easily build, train, and deploy your machine learning models by using Azure Machine Learning. Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical to deep, supervised, and unsupervised learning. Whether you prefer to write Python or R code, or use zero-code or low-code options such as the [designer](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score), you can build, train, and track highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models in a Machine Learning workspace.

You can even start training on your local machine and then scale out to the cloud. The service also interoperates with popular deep learning and reinforcement open-source tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Ray and RLlib.

Get started with [Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/). You'll find a tutorial on how to get [started with your first machine learning experiment](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup). To learn more about the open-source model format and runtime for machine learning, see [ONNX Runtime](http://onnxruntime.ai).

Common scenarios for machine learning solutions include:

- Predictive maintenance
- Inventory management
- Fraud detection
- Demand forecasting
- Intelligent recommendations
- Sales forecasting

## Checklist

- **Get started by first familiarizing yourself with Machine Learning**, and then choose which experience to begin with. You can follow along with steps to use a Jupyter notebook with Python, the visual drag-and-drop experience, or automated machine learning (AutoML).
