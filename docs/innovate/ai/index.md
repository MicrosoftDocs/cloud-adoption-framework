# AI in the Cloud Adoption Framework

Review a prescriptive framework that includes the tools, programs, and content (best practices, configuration templates, and architecture guidance) to simplify adoption of AI and cloud-native practices at scale.

The list of required actions is categorized by persona to drive a successful deployment of AI in applications, from proof of concept to production, then scaling and optimization.

## Get started

To prepare for this phase of the cloud adoption lifecycle, use the following exercises:

- [Machine Learning model development, deployment, and management](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/dev-resources/): Examine patterns and practices of building your own machine learning models, including MLOps, automated machine learning (AutoML), and Responsible ML learning tools such as InterpretML and FairLearn.
- [Adding domain-specific AI models to your applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-intelligent-apps/9781492058632/): Learn about best practices for adding AI capabilities into your applications with Cognitive Services. Also learn about the key scenarios these services help you address.
- [Build your own conversational AI solution](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/a-developers-guide/9781492080619/): Learn how to build your own Virtual Assistant, a conversational AI application that can understand language and speech, perceive vast amounts of information, and respond intelligently.
- [Build AI-driven knowledge mining solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/a-developers-guide-to-building-ai-driven-knowledge-mining-solutions/): Learn how to use knowledge mining to extract structured data from your unstructured content and discover actionable information across your organization's data.
