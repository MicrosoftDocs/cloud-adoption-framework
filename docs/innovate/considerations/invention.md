# Develop digital inventions

As described in [Innovation in the digital economy](./index.md), innovation requires a balance of *invention* and *adoption*. Customer feedback and partnership are required to drive adoption. The disciplines described in the next section define a series of approaches to developing digital inventions while keeping adoption and customer empathy in mind. Each of the disciplines is briefly described, along with deeper links into each process.

## Summary of each discipline of digital invention

The following disciplines are not *all* required to drive innovation in any given case. By following the guidance in [Build with customer empathy](./build.md), the objective is to test a hypothesis in every iteration. By defining the output of each iteration as a [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/policy-compliance#minimum-viable-product-mvp-for-policy), this should enable you to involve the fewest possible number of disciplines.

- **[Democratize data](./data.md):** By getting data into the hands of customers, partners, and employees, you encourage innovative observation. Ingest, centralize, govern, and share data.
- **[Engage through apps](./apps.md):** People connect with knowledge through apps and experiences. Empower professional and citizen developers to create apps quickly.
- **[Empower adoption](./ci-cd.md):** Encourage innovation by reducing friction to adoption and partnership. Architect for visibility, collaboration, speed, and feedback loops.
- **[Interact with devices](./devices.md):** Digital and physical lines have blurred across multiple-channels. Deliver experiences across devices, IoT, and mixed reality.
- **[Predict and influence](./predict.md):** Look to the future to lead innovation. Look past current data to inform experiences and interactions through predictive tools.

## Next steps

[Democratization of data](./data.md) is the first discipline of innovation to consider and evaluate.
