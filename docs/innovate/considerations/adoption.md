# Create customer partnerships through the build-measure-learn feedback loop

True innovation comes from the hard work of building solutions that demonstrate customer empathy, from measuring the impact of those changes on the customer, and from learning with the customer. Most importantly, it comes from feedback over multiple iterations.

If the past decade has taught us anything about innovation, it's that the old rules of business have changed. Large, wealthy incumbents no longer have an unbreakable hold on the market. The first or best players to market are always the winners. Having the best idea doesn't lead to market dominance. In a rapidly changing business climate, market leaders are the most agile. Those who can adapt to changing conditions lead.

Large or small, the companies that thrive in the digital economy as innovative leaders are those with the greatest ability to listen to their customer base. That skill can be cultivated and managed. At the core of all good partnerships is a clear feedback loop. The process for building customer partnerships within the Cloud Adoption Framework is the build-measure-learn feedback loop.

## The build-measure-learn feedback loop

As described in [Innovation in the digital economy](./index.md), innovation requires a balance of *invention* and *adoption*. Customer feedback and partnership drive adoption. By turning your customers into strong, loyal partners during innovation cycles, you can realize better products and gain quicker traction in the market.

This process for managing customer partnerships and integrating them into your innovation efforts includes three phases of development:

- [Build with customer empathy](./build.md)
- [Measure for customer impact](./measure.md)
- [Learn with customers](./learn.md)

Each phase of the process helps you build better solutions with your customers.
