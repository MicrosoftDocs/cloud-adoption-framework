# Engage customers through applications

Build cloud-native applications to connect customers in new ways. Cloud-native applications are built from the ground up, optimized for cloud scale and performance. Cloud-native applications are based on microservices architecture, use managed services, and take advantage of continuous delivery to achieve reliability and faster time to market.

Innovation with applications includes both modernizing your existing applications that are hosted on-premises and building cloud-native applications by using containers or serverless technologies. Azure provides PaaS services like Azure App Service to help you easily modernize your existing web and API apps written in .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, Ruby, Python, or PHP for deployment in Azure.

With an open-standard container model, building microservices or containerizing your existing applications and deploying them on Azure is simple when you use managed services like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Instances, and Web App for Containers. Serverless technologies like Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps use a consumption model (pay for what you use) and help you focus on building your application rather than deploying and managing infrastructure.

## [Deliver value faster](#tab/DeliverValueFaster)

One of the advantages of cloud-based solutions is the ability to gather feedback faster and start delivering value to your user. Whether that user is an external customer or a user in your own company, the faster you can get feedback on your applications, the better.

### Azure App Service

Azure App Service provides a hosting environment for your applications that removes the burden of infrastructure management and OS patching. It provides automation of scale to meet the demands of your users while bound by limits that you define to keep costs in check.

Azure App Service provides first-class support for languages like ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python. If you need to host another runtime stack, Web App for Containers lets you quickly and easily host a Docker container within App Service, so you can host your custom code stack in an environment that gets you out of the server business.

#### Action

## [Create cloud-native applications](#tab/CloudNative)

### What are cloud-native applications?

Cloud-native applications are built from the ground up, optimized for cloud scale and performance. They're loosely coupled based on microservices architecture, use managed services, can be observable, and take advantage of continuous delivery to achieve reliability and faster time to market. Typically, they're portable and can run on dynamic environments like public, private, and hybrid clouds. Cloud-native applications are usually built with one or more of the following approaches:

- Microservices
- Serverless
- Containers

### Microservices

Microservices is a software architecture style in which applications are composed of small independent modules that communicate with each other via well-defined API contracts. These service modules are highly decoupled building blocks that are small enough to implement a single functionality. Microservices helps you:

- Build services independently.
- Scale services autonomously.
- Use the most suitable approaches for deployment and programming languages.
- Isolate points of failure.
- Deliver value faster.

### Microservices: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Use a fully managed Kubernetes service to handle provisioning, upgrading, and scaling of cluster resources on demand. AKS makes deploying and managing containerized applications easy. It offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. Unite your development and operations teams on a single platform to rapidly build, deliver, and scale applications with confidence.

#### Action

To configure or monitor an AKS service:

1. Go to **Azure Kubernetes Services**.
2. Configure a new service: select **Add** and follow the prompts.
3. Manage existing services: select the desired Kubernetes service from the list.

### Serverless solutions

Build cloud-native applications without provisioning and managing infrastructure by using a fully managed platform that handles scaling, availability, and performance for you. Benefits of Azure serverless solutions include:

- Increasing developer velocity.
- Boosting team performance.
- Improving organizational impact.

### Serverless solutions: Azure Functions

Azure Functions provides a platform for running small units of code or functions in the cloud. Functions can be a way to start refactoring your code into a microservices architecture.

The Azure Functions runtime supports many languages, including C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. For a complete list, see [Supported languages in Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages).

Another benefit of functions is that they can be triggered by different actions and events, like HTTP triggers, timer triggers, and triggers from other Azure services like Blob Storage, Event Grid, and Service Bus. For more information about triggers and bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings).

#### Action

To configure or monitor Azure Functions deployments:

1. Go to **Function App**.
2. Configure a new function app: select **Add** and follow the prompts.
3. Manage existing function apps: select the desired function app from the list.

### Containers

For modernizing your application portfolio, Azure provides various container services to migrate your existing applications to containers and build cloud-native microservices applications so you can deliver value to your users faster. Use end-to-end developer and CI/CD tools to develop, update, and deploy your containerized applications. Manage containers at scale with a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service that integrates with Azure Active Directory. Wherever you're in your application modernization journey, accelerate your containerized application development while meeting your security requirements.

### Containers: Azure Container Instances

Run Docker containers on-demand in a managed serverless Azure environment. Azure Container Instances is a solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers without orchestration. When you run your workloads in container instances, you can focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.

#### Action

To configure or monitor container instances:

1. Go to **Container instances**.
2. Configure a new container instance: select **Add** and follow the prompts.
3. Manage existing container instances: select the desired container instance from the list.
