# Before you start

::: zone-end

Before you start developing innovative solutions by using Azure services, you need to prepare your environment, which includes preparing to manage customer feedback loops. In this guide, we introduce features that help you engage customers, build solutions, and drive adoption. For more information, best practices, and considerations related to preparing your cloud environment, see the [Cloud Adoption Framework innovate section](../index.md).

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Manage customer feedback:** Set up tools and processes to manage the build-measure-learn feedback loop by using GitHub and Azure DevOps.
> - **Democratize data:** Data alone might be enough to drive innovative solutions to your customers. Deploy common data options in Azure.
> - **Engage through apps:** Some innovation requires an engaging experience. Leverage cloud-native application platforms to create engaging experiences.
> - **Empower adoption:** Invention is great, but a plan to reduce friction is needed to empower and scale adoption. Deploy a foundation for CI/CD, DevOps, and other adoption enablers.
> - **Interact through devices:** Create ambient experiences to bring your apps and data closer to the customers' point of need. IoT, mixed reality, and mobile experiences are easier with Azure.
> - **Predict and influence:** Find patterns in data. Put those patterns to work to predict and influence customer behaviors by using Azure-based predictive analytics tools.
