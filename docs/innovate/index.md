# Cloud innovation in the Cloud Adoption Framework

All IT portfolios contain a few workloads and ideas that could significantly improve a company's position in the market. Most cloud adoption efforts focus on the migration and modernization of existing workloads. It's innovation, however, that can provide the greatest business value. Cloud adoption-related innovation can unlock new technical skills and expanded business capabilities.

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework focuses on the elements of your portfolio that drive the greatest return on investment.

To prepare you for this phase of the cloud adoption lifecycle, the framework suggests the following exercises:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

| | |
|---|---|
| <br> ![1](../_images/icons/1.png)     | [Business value consensus](./business-value.md): Before you decide on technical solutions, identify how new innovation can drive business value. Map that value to your cloud strategy. In this incremental methodology, business value is represented by a hypothesis about customer needs.                                |
| <br> ![2](../_images/icons/2.png)     | [Azure innovation guide](./innovation-guide/index.md): Azure includes cloud tools to accelerate the deployment of innovative solutions. Depending on your hypothesis, you might consider various combinations of tools. The creation of a minimum viable product (MVP) with basic tools is suggested.                                |
| <br>![3](../_images/icons/3.png)     | [Best practices](./best-practices/index.md): Your architectural decisions should follow best practices for each tool in the toolchain. By adhering to such guidance, you can better accelerate solution development and provide a reference for solid architectural designs.                                |
| <br>![4](../_images/icons/4.png)      | [Feedback loops](./considerations/adoption.md): During each iteration, the solutions under development offer a way for your teams to learn alongside customers. Fast and accurate feedback loops with your customers can help you better test, measure, learn, and ultimately reduce the time to market impact. Learn how Azure and GitHub accelerate feedback loops.                        |

## Innovation summary

The [considerations overview](./considerations/index.md) establishes a common language for innovation across application development, DevOps, IT, and business teams. The following approach builds on existing lean methodologies. It's designed to help you create a cloud-focused conversation about customer adoption and a scientific model for creating business value. The approach also maps existing Azure services to manageable decision processes. This alignment can help you find the right technical options to address specific customer needs or hypotheses.

## Suggested skills

Readiness for the new skills and responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily. Microsoft Learn provides a rewarding approach to hands-on learning that helps you achieve your goals faster. Earn points and levels, and achieve more!

Here are a couple of examples of role-specific learning paths on Microsoft Learn that align with the Innovate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework.

[Administer containers in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/administer-containers-in-azure): Azure Container Instances (ACI) are the quickest and easiest way to run containers in Azure. This learning path will teach you how to create and manage your containers, and how you can use ACI to provide elastic scale for Kubernetes.

[Create serverless applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-serverless-applications): Azure Functions enable the creation of event-driven, compute-on-demand systems that can be triggered by various external events. Learn how to use functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures.

To discover additional learning paths, browse the [Learn catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse). Use the **Roles** filter to align learning paths with your role.
