## Deploy to production and apply best practices

As you prepare the application for production, you should implement a minimum set of best practices. Use the checklist below at this stage. You should be able to answer these questions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Can you monitor all aspects of your application?
> - Have you defined resource requirements for your application? How about scaling requirements?
> - Can you deploy new versions of the application without affecting production systems?

> | Checklist  | Resources                                                                                                     |
> |------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
> | **Configure readiness and liveness health checks.** Kubernetes uses readiness and liveness checks to know when to your application is ready to receive traffic and when it needs to be restarted. Without defining such checks, Kubernetes will not be able to determine if your application is up and running. | [Liveness and readiness checks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes) |
> | **Configure logging, application monitoring, and alerting.** Monitoring your containers is critical, especially when you're running a production cluster, at scale, with multiple applications. The recommended logging method for containerized applications is writing to the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams. | [Logging in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging) <br> [Get started with monitoring and alerting for Kubernetes (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7aN_z-cyUw&list=PLLasX02E8BPCrIhFrc_ZiINhbRkYMKdPT&index=16) <br> [Azure Monitor for containers](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-overview) <br> [Enable and review Kubernetes master node logs in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/view-master-logs) <br> [View Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real time](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-livedata-overview) |
> | **Define resource requirements for the application.** A primary way to manage the compute resources within a Kubernetes cluster is using pod requests and limits. These requests and limits tell the Kubernetes scheduler what compute resources a pod should be assigned. | [Define&nbsp;pod&nbsp;resource&nbsp;requests&nbsp;and&nbsp;limits](/azure/aks/developer-best-practices-resource-management) |
> | **Configure application scaling requirements.** Kubernetes supports horizontal pod autoscaling to adjust the number of pods in a deployment depending on CPU utilization or other select metrics. To use the autoscaler, all containers in your pods must have CPU requests and limits defined. | [Configure horizontal pod autoscaling](/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-scale#autoscale-pods) |
> | **Deploy applications using an automated pipeline and DevOps.** The full automation of all steps between code commit to production deployment allows teams to focus on building code and removes the overhead and potential human error in manual mundane steps. Deploying new code is quicker and less risky, helping teams become more agile, more productive, and more confident about their running code. | [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices) <br> [Setting up a Kubernetes build pipeline (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5irsAdKoEBU&list=PLLasX02E8BPCrIhFrc_ZiINhbRkYMKdPT&index=6) <br> [Deployment Center for Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/deployment-center-launcher) <br> [GitHub Actions for deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/kubernetes-action) <br> [CI/CD to Azure Kubernetes Service with Jenkins](/azure/aks/jenkins-continuous-deployment) |

## Optimize and scale

Now that the application is in production, how can you optimize your workflow and prepare your application and team to scale? Use the optimization and scaling checklist to prepare. You should be able to answer these questions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Are cross-cutting application concerns abstracted from your application?
> - Are you able to maintain system and application reliability, while still iterating on new features and versions?

> |------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
> | **Deploy an API gateway.** An API gateway serves as an entry point to microservices, decouples clients from your microservices, adds an additional layer of security, and decreases the complexity of your microservices by removing the burden of handling cross-cutting concerns.     | [Use Azure API Management with microservices deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/api-management/api-management-kubernetes) |
> | **Deploy a service mesh.** A service mesh provides capabilities like traffic management, resiliency, policy, security, strong identity, and observability to your workloads. Your application is decoupled from these operational capabilities and the service mesh moves them out of the application layer and down to the infrastructure layer.     | [How&nbsp;service&nbsp;meshes&nbsp;work&nbsp;in&nbsp;Kubernetes&nbsp;(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izVWk7rYqWI&list=PLLasX02E8BPCrIhFrc_ZiINhbRkYMKdPT&index=15&t=0s) <br> [Learn about service mesh](/azure/aks/servicemesh-about) <br> [Use Istio with Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/servicemesh-istio-about) <br> [Use Linkerd with Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/servicemesh-linkerd-about) <br> [Use Consul with Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/servicemesh-consul-about) |
> | **Implement site reliability engineering (SRE) practices.** Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a proven approach to maintain crucial system and application reliability while iterating at the speed demanded by the marketplace.   | [Introduction to site reliability engineering (SRE)](/learn/modules/intro-to-site-reliability-engineering) <br> [DevOps at Microsoft: Game streaming SRE](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/devops-at-microsoft-game-streaming-sre) |
