Include rollback triggers, data backup and restoration procedures, and recovery validation steps. Test rollback and recovery procedures regularly to ensure they work correctly when needed. This preparation reduces downtime and provides. For more information, see [Define rollback plan](./plan-migration.md#define-rollback-plan).
