Deployment documentation ensures that teams can consistently deploy and maintain workloads across environments. It also supports troubleshooting and compliance.

1. **Document configuration changes and deployment procedures.** Record all environment-specific settings, connection strings, service endpoints, and security configurations in accessible documentation. Include step-by-step deployment instructions, prerequisite requirements, and post-deployment validation steps. This documentation enables consistent deployments and supports troubleshooting when issues occur.

2. **Update rollback and recovery procedures.** Create detailed steps to revert changes when deployment issues occur. Include rollback triggers, data backup and restoration procedures, and recovery validation steps. Test rollback procedures regularly to ensure they work correctly when needed. This preparation reduces downtime and provides. For more information, see [Define rollback plan](./plan-migration.md#define-rollback-plan).

3. **Update contact and escalation lists for deployment support.** Identify who needs to be available during deployment and how to reach them quickly. Create a contact list that includes one person each from development, operations, database administration, networking, and business stakeholders if needed. Define escalation contacts for situations the deployment team cannot resolve independently, such as an architect or vendor support representative. Prepare external support contact information, including Microsoft support or other vendor numbers, before the deployment begins.
