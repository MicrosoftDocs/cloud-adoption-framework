1. **Create IaC templates for proven configurations.** Use [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), [Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/overview), or [Azure Resource Manager templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) to define your infrastructure. For more information, see [CAF Manage - Manage code-based deployments](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-code-deployments).

2. **Store templates in version-controlled repositories.** Use [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/repositories) or [Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/repos/get-started/) to manage IaC assets with proper version control. Version control enables code reviews, supports team collaboration, and encourages template reuse across projects. This approach provides complete traceability for infrastructure changes and supports rollback capabilities when issues occur.

3. **Automate dependency installation and configuration.** Create CI/CD deployment pipelines or scripts that automatically install and configure application dependencies. Use [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), or Azure CLI scripts to automate these steps. Include configuration files, environment variables, and [secrets management](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) in your automation process. This automation eliminates manual configuration errors and ensures consistent behavior across all environments.

4. **Validate infrastructure provisioning end-to-end.** Test that your IaC templates, pipelines, and scripts can create the complete infrastructure stack from nothing. Test different deployment scenarios including initial deployment, configuration updates, and rollback procedures to confirm the automation works correctly. Use separate Azure subscriptions or resource groups for testing to prevent conflicts with production resources and maintain environment isolation.
