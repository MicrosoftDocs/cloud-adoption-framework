1. **Map application dependencies first.** Use tools to discover communication patterns between applications. Dependency mapping identifies which systems exchange data or rely on shared services. This step is critical to avoid migrating a system in isolation that depends on another system still on-premises. For detailed guidance, see [Map internal and external dependencies](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/assess-workloads-for-cloud-migration#map-internal-and-external-dependencies).

2. **Create dependency groups.** Group workloads that share databases, APIs, authentication services, or network connections. These groups form the foundation of your migration. Grouping by dependency ensures that all components required for functionality move together, reducing post-migration troubleshooting.

3. **Validate group completeness.** Confirm that each group includes all necessary components for the applications to operate. Include supporting infrastructure such as load balancers, DNS records, or caching layers. Incomplete groups can lead to service outages or degraded performance after migration.
