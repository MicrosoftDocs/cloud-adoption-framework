1. **Plan for unmovable dependencies.** Identify components that must stay in your source environment due to technical or regulatory reasons. Document why they can't move, how they connect to other systems, and what data they share. This documentation helps you create strategies for these components to work smoothly with your cloud systems.

1. **Minimize split-environment operation time.** When components can move to the cloud later but not immediately, document their connections and data flows with cloud systems. Create a clear plan with timelines and risk management approaches to reduce the time your workload operates across both environments. Consider delaying the migration until more components can move together.

1. **Connect environments effectively.** Use integration methods like API gateways, message queues, and data synchronization to create reliable connections between your cloud workloads and source environment components. These approaches reduce delays, improve security, and prepare the way for eventually moving remaining components to the cloud.
