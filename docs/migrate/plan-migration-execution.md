# Plan migration execution

A migration execution plan defines the specific order, timing, and approach for migrating workloads to Azure. This plan translates high-level migration strategies into actionable deployment sequences. It builds on the cloud adoption plan by addressing tactical decisions such as workload prioritization, migration sequencing, and data transfer methods.

Migration execution planning occurs in the CAF Migrate methodology rather than CAF Plan because several critical factors emerge only after you have built and operated your Azure landing zone:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Operational readiness validation** | Working with your deployed landing zone reveals actual team capabilities, operational processes, and support requirements that influence migration complexity and timing. |
| **Technical constraints discovery** | Network bandwidth, connectivity patterns, and Azure service performance become clear through operational experience, affecting data migration path selections and transfer timelines. |
| **Changing business priorities** | The time between initial planning and migration execution often brings new business requirements, regulatory changes, or shifting organizational priorities that require updated migration sequencing. |
| **Resource availability confirmation** | Actual Azure resource provisioning, cost patterns, and operational overhead become visible through landing zone operations, enabling more accurate migration resource planning and scheduling. |
| **Risk tolerance refinement** | Experience with Azure operations and incident management provides clearer understanding of acceptable downtime windows and rollback requirements for different workload types. |

These factors make migration execution planning a distinct activity that builds on both your initial cloud adoption plan and your operational experience with Azure landing zones.

## Assess migration readiness and skills

A readiness assessment ensures that your team has the skills and support needed to execute the migration plan. This step identifies capability gaps and accelerates progress through targeted training or external support.

1. **Evaluate internal skills and experience.** Review your teamâ€™s familiarity with Azure services, migration tools, and workload patterns. This evaluation identifies potential blockers and training needs. Use the [Migration skills](./migration-skills.md).

2. **Engage external expertise if needed.** If internal capabilities are limited, bring in [Microsoft or a Microsoft partner](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/migration/migrate-modernize-innovate/#Nextsteps). External experts can validate your strategy, tools, and timelines. This support accelerates progress and reduces risk, especially for complex or large-scale migrations.

## Determine the data migration path

A data migration path defines how data moves from your current environment to Azure. Selecting the right path ensures secure, timely, and cost-effective data transfer. Identify whether ExpressRoute, VPN, or public internet is available and configured. This assessment determines which migration paths are technically feasible and secure.

1. **Use ExpressRoute for all workloads if available.** Use ExpressRoute if it is already provisioned or planned for your environment. ExpressRoute provides private, dedicated connectivity to Azure, which improves performance and security. This method is ideal for all workloads but requires setup and incurs additional cost for data transfer.

2. **Use VPN when ExpressRoute is unavailable.** Select VPN when you need encrypted data transfer over the internet but do not have ExpressRoute. VPN provides a secure tunnel to Azure but may have lower throughput and higher latency compared to ExpressRoute. Ensure VPN Gateway is configured in your Azure environment.

3. **Use public internet for non-sensitive data.** Choose this method when encryption is not required, ExpressRoute is unavailable, and the data is not suitable for offline transfer. This method is universally available but less secure and may impact bandwidth for other operations.

4. **Use Azure Data Box for large, non-critical offline transfers.** Select Azure Data Box when transferring large volumes of data that are not time-sensitive or business-critical. This method avoids network congestion but is the slowest due to shipping and manual handling. Order and configure the Data Box from the Azure portal.

| Data Migration Path | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|----------------------|-------------|------|------|
| ExpressRoute | If ExpressRoute is available | Secure and fast | Requires setup and cost |
| VPN | If secure transfer is required and ExpressRoute is not available | More secure than public internet | Requires VPN setup |
| Public internet | If no secure path is needed and data is not viable for Data Box | Universally available | Least secure, uses internet bandwidth |
| Azure Data Box | For large, non-critical data | Offline bulk transfer | Slowest method |

## Determine the migration sequence

Migration sequencing reduces risk and builds team confidence by establishing a logical order for workload migration. The sequence determines which workloads move first and how dependent systems migrate together to prevent service disruptions.

1. **Organize large portfolios into migration waves.** Create migration waves when you have multiple workloads to migrate. Each wave should contain workloads with similar complexity levels, risk profiles, or technical dependencies. This approach allows you to learn from each wave and apply improvements to subsequent migrations. Migration waves also provide manageable project scopes that teams can execute successfully without overwhelming resources. For detailed guidance on wave planning, see [Migration wave planning](./migration-wave-plan.md).

2. **Validate workload criticality classifications before sequencing.** Confirm that business criticality levels accurately reflect current operations and service requirements. Use your migration adoption plan to identify all workloads in scope and review their metadata including workload owner, business unit, and technical dependencies. Engage workload owners and business stakeholders to validate criticality classifications and ensure they align with current business priorities. This validation prevents low-priority workloads from blocking critical system migrations and ensures that migration execution matches business expectations. For more information, see [Migration adoption plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/migration-adoption-plan#details-on-each-workload).

3. **Prioritize non-critical workloads for early migration.** Begin with development environments, test systems, and internal applications that have flexible downtime requirements. These workloads provide low-risk opportunities to validate migration tools, test Azure configurations, and refine migration processes before tackling business-critical systems. Early wins with non-critical workloads build team confidence and reveal potential issues that you can address before migrating production systems.

4. **Group dependent workloads into the same migration wave.** Migrate interdependent systems together to prevent broken integrations and service disruptions. Use dependency mapping tools like Azure Migrate to discover integration points, shared databases, and API connections between workloads. Group these dependent systems into single migration waves to maintain functionality during the transition. This approach reduces the complexity of managing hybrid environments and minimizes the risk of service outages. [Map internal and external dependencies](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/assess-workloads-for-cloud-migration#map-internal-and-external-dependencies).

5. **Minimize hybrid environment duration for dependent workloads.** When you cannot migrate all dependent workloads simultaneously, create specific plans to manage the hybrid state. Document integration gaps and implement mitigation strategies such as API proxies, database replication, or temporary bridging solutions. Define clear timelines to complete the full migration of dependent workloads and assign dedicated teams to manage both on-premises and cloud environments during the transition. Use Azure Monitor to maintain visibility across hybrid boundaries and validate that systems can recover from failures.

6. **Establish specific migration timelines with business alignment.** Create concrete timelines that include specific dates for each migration wave and individual workload migrations. Align these schedules with business calendars to avoid peak periods such as month-end processing for financial systems or holiday seasons for retail applications. Include dependencies between tasks and build in buffer time for unexpected delays. Use project management tools to track progress and communicate timeline changes immediately to all stakeholders when delays occur.

7. **Migrate non-production environments first for each workload.** Always migrate development, staging, and QA environments before production systems. This sequence allows you to validate the complete migration process, test application behavior in Azure, and confirm that performance meets expectations. Use non-production migrations to identify configuration issues, validate backup and recovery procedures, and train operations teams on Azure management before production cutover.

## Determine offline or near-zero downtime migration

A workload's downtime tolerance determines the appropriate migration strategy. Workloads with flexible downtime requirements can use offline migration, which the preferred method. Offline migration simplifies the process and reduces risk of data lost. Mission-critical workloads that require continuous availability need online migration strategies that maintain operations during the transition. However, online migrations often require temporary downtime depending on the tools used and technology stack of the workload.

1. **Assess workload downtime tolerance through business requirements.** Review service level agreements (SLAs), recovery time objectives (RTOs), and business continuity plans to determine acceptable downtime periods. Work with business stakeholders to define specific downtime windows based on operational impact and customer commitments. This assessment ensures that migration timing aligns with business needs and regulatory requirements. Consider factors such as customer-facing services, revenue-generating systems, and compliance obligations when evaluating downtime tolerance.

2. **Identify workloads suitable for offline migration.** Evaluate workloads that can accommodate planned downtime during migration. These typically include development environments, test systems, internal applications, and workloads with scheduled maintenance windows. Offline migration reduces complexity by eliminating the need for real-time data synchronization and provides a cleaner cutover process. Document the acceptable downtime duration for each workload and align migration schedules with business calendars to avoid peak periods such as month-end processing or seasonal demand.

3. **Classify workloads requiring near-zero downtime migration.** Identify workloads that must remain operational during migration to meet business continuity requirements. These include customer-facing applications, real-time transaction systems, and services covered by strict SLAs. Use business impact analysis to determine which systems fall into this category. Validate that the workload architecture supports continuous replication and that network bandwidth can handle real-time data transfer requirements. Consider implementing blue-green deployment strategies or using Azure Site Recovery for these critical systems.

4. **Validate technical requirements for online migration.** Ensure that workloads requiring near-zero downtime have the necessary technical capabilities for online migration. This includes support for database replication, application-level failover, and network connectivity that can sustain continuous data synchronization. Assess data volume, change rate, and interdependencies to confirm that online migration is technically feasible. Test connectivity between source and target environments to verify sufficient bandwidth and low latency for real-time replication.

5. **Plan migration windows for offline workloads.** Schedule offline migrations during approved maintenance windows or low-usage periods to minimize business impact. Coordinate with operations teams to ensure that migration activities do not conflict with other system maintenance or business-critical processes. Create detailed migration schedules that include preparation time, data transfer duration, testing phases, and contingency buffers. Communicate these schedules to all stakeholders and establish approval processes for any changes to migration timing.

## Define rollback plan

A rollback strategy is a documented plan that enables teams to revert infrastructure or application changes when deployment fails or introduces risk. A clear rollback strategy reduces downtime, limits business disruption, and supports operational resilience. You should define rollback criteria and procedures before any migration or deployment activity.

### Establish rollback criteria

1. **Define failure thresholds with stakeholders.** Work with business stakeholders, workload owners, and operations teams to establish what constitutes a failed deployment. Common thresholds include failed health checks, performance degradation, security violations, or unmet success metrics. This collaboration ensures rollback decisions match your organization's risk tolerance.

2. **Document rollback triggers in the deployment plan.** Record the rollback criteria in your deployment plan to provide visibility and accountability. Include measurable indicators such as CPU thresholds, response time limits, or error rates. This documentation supports consistent decision-making during incidents.

3. **Integrate rollback logic into CI/CD pipelines.** Use tools like [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages) or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) to automate rollback steps. For example, configure pipelines to redeploy a previous build if a deployment fails health checks.

### Document rollback procedures

1. **Create workload-specific rollback instructions.** Develop rollback steps that match your workload type, environment, and deployment method. For example, infrastructure-as-code deployments require reapplying previous templates, while application rollbacks involve redeploying a prior container image.

2. **Include rollback assets in documentation.** Attach rollback scripts, configuration snapshots, and infrastructure-as-code templates to your rollback plan. These assets enable rapid execution and reduce dependence on manual intervention.

### Test rollback procedures in a pre-production environment

1. **Simulate failure scenarios in staging.** Use a pre-production environment to simulate deployment failures and validate rollback effectiveness. This testing helps identify gaps in automation, permissions, or dependencies.

2. **Verify system recovery to a known-good state.** Confirm that rollback restores the system to a stable and functional configuration. This verification builds confidence in your rollback plan and supports operational readiness.

### Review and update rollback strategies after each deployment

1. **Conduct post-incident reviews.** After each deployment or rollback event, assess what worked and what didn't. Identify gaps in criteria, procedures, or automation.

2. **Update rollback documentation based on lessons learned.** Revise rollback plans to reflect new insights, changes in architecture, or updated tooling. This practice keeps rollback strategies current and effective.

## Engage stakeholders on migration execution plan

Stakeholder approval validates your migration execution plan and ensures business alignment for the first wave of workloads. This approval process confirms that your proposed migration approaches, timelines, and rollback procedures meet business requirements and risk tolerance. You should present a comprehensive execution plan that demonstrates readiness and builds stakeholder confidence.

1. **Present the first wave workload migration plan with clear business justification.** Document each workload in the first wave with its business criticality, migration approach (offline or near-zero downtime), and rationale for the chosen method. Include the business impact of each workload's downtime and how your migration approach minimizes risk. Use a structured format that shows workload name, owner, migration type, scheduled downtime window, and business justification. This presentation helps stakeholders understand the careful planning behind each decision.

2. **Demonstrate rollback procedures for each workload in the first wave.** Present specific rollback plans for each workload that detail the steps, timeframes, and success criteria for reverting changes. Include automated rollback capabilities where available and manual procedures where required. Show how rollback procedures were tested in pre-production environments and document the results. This demonstration proves that you can restore services quickly if migration issues occur.

3. **Validate migration schedules against business calendar constraints.** Review your proposed migration timeline with business stakeholders to confirm it avoids critical business periods, maintenance freezes, and seasonal peaks. Present alternative scheduling options if conflicts exist and explain the trade-offs of each approach. Include specific dates, duration estimates, and dependencies between workloads. This validation ensures migration activities align with business operations and minimizes disruption.

4. **Secure formal approval for migration execution and rollback authority.** Obtain written approval from business stakeholders for the migration execution plan, including authorization to execute rollback procedures if needed. Define decision-making authority for rollback scenarios and ensure key stakeholders understand their roles during potential recovery situations. Document approval signatures and communication channels for emergency decisions. This formal approval provides clear authority to proceed and establishes accountability.

5. **Establish success criteria and checkpoints for the first wave.** Define measurable success metrics for each workload migration and establish go/no-go checkpoints throughout the process. Include performance benchmarks, functionality validation steps, and user acceptance criteria. Schedule formal review points where stakeholders can assess progress and make continuation decisions. These criteria provide objective measures for migration success and enable data-driven decisions about proceeding to subsequent waves.
