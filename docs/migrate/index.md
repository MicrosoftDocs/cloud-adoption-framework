# CAF Migrate

The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Migrate methodology provides structured guidance for executing your migration plan to Azure in manageable waves. This approach ensures a smooth and efficient transition of workloads to the cloud. Use the following checklist to review the key steps and tasks associated with CAF Migrate. This helps you confirm that all prerequisites are met and that you're fully prepared to begin migration.

## Meet migration requirements

Before starting CAF Migrate, you need:

- A [migration adoption plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/migration-adoption-plan#details-on-each-workload), which details your existing ([inventory](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/discover-existing-workload-inventory), [migration strategy per workload](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/select-cloud-migration-strategy), and [workload assessments](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/assess-workloads-for-cloud-migration)). This plan is a critical prerequisite for successfully migrating workloads to Azure.

- An [Azure landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) in place, along with a defined process for creating and managing subscriptions for your workloads and workload teams. 

These foundational elements ensure that your environment is ready to support scalable, secure, and well-governed cloud adoption.

## Migration checklist

| Migration step | Migration tasks |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Plan migration execution |  |
| Prepare workloads | Conduct  |
| Execute migration cutover |  |
| Optimize after migration |  |
| Decommission source workloads |  |

## Understand the important of migration guidance

A structured migration approach reduces business risk and accelerates time to value. Migration projects without proper sequencing often encounter unexpected dependencies, cost overruns, and extended downtime. You should follow a proven methodology that breaks complex migrations into manageable phases with clear success criteria.
