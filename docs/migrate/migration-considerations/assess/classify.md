# Workload classification before migration

During each iteration of any migration process, one or more workloads are migrated and promoted to production. Before either of those migration activities, it's important to classify each workload. Classification helps clarify governance, security, operations, and cloud-scale analytics requirements.

The following guidance builds on the suggested tagging requirements outlined in the [Define your tagging strategy](../../../ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging.md) article. This article builds by adding important [operations](../../../manage/considerations/criticality.md#criticality-scale) and [governance](../../../govern/guides/complex/prescriptive-guidance.md#resource-tagging) elements.

In this article, we specifically suggest adding criticality and data sensitivity to your existing tagging standards. Each of these data points can help other teams understand which workloads might require other attention or support.

## Data sensitivity

[Data classification](../../../govern/policy-compliance/data-classification.md) measures the impact that a data leak would have on the business or customers. The governance and security teams use data sensitivity or data classification as an indicator of security risks. During assessment, the cloud adoption team should evaluate the data classification for each workload targeted for migration and share that classification with supporting teams. Workloads that deal strictly in "public data" might not have any influence on supporting teams. As data becomes highly confidential, both governance and security teams likely have a vested interest in participating in the workload assessment.

Work with your security and governance teams as early as possible to define the following items:

- A clear process for sharing any workloads on the backlog with sensitive data.
- An understanding of the governance requirements and security baseline that's required for various different levels of data sensitivity.
- Any influence data sensitivity can have on subscription design, management group hierarchies, or landing zone requirements.
- Any requirements for testing data classification, which can include specific tooling or defined scope of classification.

## Mission criticality

[Workload criticality](../../../manage/considerations/criticality.md) is a measure of how significantly the business is affected during an outage. This data point helps operations management and security teams evaluate risks involving outages and breaches. During assessment, the cloud adoption team should evaluate mission criticality for each workload targeted for migration and share that classification with supporting teams. "Low" or "unsupported" workloads are likely to have little influence on the supporting teams. However, as workloads approach "mission critical" or "unit critical" classifications, their operational dependencies become more visible.

Work with your security and operations teams as early as possible to define the following items:

- A clear process for sharing any workloads on the backlog with support requirements.
- An understanding of the operations management and resource consistency requirements for various criticality levels.
- Any influence criticality might have on subscription design, management group hierarchies, or landing zone requirements.
- Any requirements for documenting criticality, which might include specific traffic or usage reports, financial analyses, or other tools.

## Next steps

Once workloads are properly classified, it's much easier to [align business priorities](./business-priorities.md).
