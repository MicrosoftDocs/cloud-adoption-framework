# Design workload architectures before migration

This article describes the assessment process. It helps you review activities associated with defining the workload's architecture within a given iteration. As discussed in the article on [incremental rationalization](../../../digital-estate/rationalize.md), some architectural assumptions are made during any business transformation that requires a migration. This article clarifies those assumptions. It shares a few roadblocks that can be avoided and identifies opportunities to accelerate business value by challenging those assumptions. This incremental model for architecture allows teams to move faster and to obtain business outcomes sooner.

## Architecture assumptions before migration

The following assumptions are typical for any migration effort:

- **IaaS.** Migrating workloads primarily involves moving virtual machines from a physical datacenter to a cloud datacenter via an IaaS migration. This process typically requires a minimum of redevelopment or reconfiguration. The approach is known as a *lift and shift* migration. (Exceptions follow.)
- **Architecture consistency.** Changes to core architecture during a migration considerably increase complexity. Debugging a changed system on a new platform introduces many variables that can be difficult to isolate. For this reason, workloads should undergo only minor changes during migration and any changes should be thoroughly tested.
- **Retirement test.** Migrations and the hosting of assets consume operational and potential capital expenses. Assume that any workloads you migrate have been reviewed to validate ongoing usage. The choice to retire unused assets produces immediate cost savings.
- **Resize assets.** Assume few on-premises assets are fully using the given resources. Before migration, assets are resized to best fit actual usage requirements.
- **Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) requirements.** Assume that an agreed-on SLA for the workload has been negotiated with the business before release planning. These requirements are likely to produce minor architecture changes.
- **Migration downtime.** Likewise, downtime to promote the workload to production can have an adverse effect on the business. Sometimes, the solutions that must transition with minimum downtime need architecture changes. Assume that a general understanding of downtime requirements has been established before release planning.
- **User traffic patterns.** Existing solutions may depend on existing network routing patterns. These patterns could slow performance considerably. Further, introduction of new hybrid wide area network (WAN) solutions can take weeks or even months. Before migration, assume that your landing zones have already considered the relevant traffic patterns and changes to any core infrastructure services.

## Mitigating potential roadblocks

The itemized assumptions can create roadblocks that could slow progress or cause later pain points. The following are a few roadblocks to watch for, before the release:

- **Paying for technical debt.** Some aging workloads carry with them a high amount of technical debt. Technical debt can lead to long-term challenges by increasing hosting costs with any cloud provider. When technical debt unnaturally increases hosting costs, alternative architectures should be evaluated.
- **Improving reliability.** Standard operations baselines provide a degree of reliability and recovery in the cloud. But, some workload teams may require higher SLAs, which could lead to architectural changes.
- **High-cost workloads.**  During migration, all assets should be optimized to align sizing with actual usage. But, some workloads may require architectural modifications to address specific cost concerns.
- **Performance requirements.** When workload performance directly affects business, extra architectural consideration may be required.
- **Secure applications.** Security requirements tend to be implemented centrally and applied to all workloads in the portfolio. But, some workloads may have specific security requirements that could lead to architectural changes.

Each of the above criteria serves as indicators of potential migration roadblocks. The above criteria is addressed after a workload is migrated. But if any of those criteria are required before you migrate a workload, remove the workload the migration wave and evaluate it individually.

The [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/) and [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review) can help guide those conversations with the technical owner of a specific workload to consider alternative options for deploying the workload. Those workloads would then be classified as a rearchitecture effort in your cloud adoption plan. Given the extra time that's required to rearchitect a workload, these alternative workload adoption paths shouldn't be considered part of the migration process.

## Accelerate business value

Some scenarios could require a different architecture than the assumed IaaS rehosting strategy. The following are a few examples:

- **PaaS modernization.** You can migrate some technology assets to more modern Platform as a Service solutions, reducing risk during migration. Automated migration tools like Azure Migrate suggest and even automate modernization opportunities. A few examples of in-flight modernization include low risk changes like the use of [Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)](/azure/dms/dms-overview) to modernize databases. For a list of approaches that could benefit from a PaaS conversion, see the article on [evaluating assets](./evaluate.md).
- **Scripted deployments/DevOps.** If a workload has an existing DevOps deployment or other forms of scripted deployment, the cost of changing those scripts could be lower than the cost of migrating the asset.
- **Remediation efforts.** The remediation efforts required to prepare a workload for migration can be extensive. In some cases, it makes more sense to modernize the solution than it does to remediate underlying compatibility issues.

In each of these itemized scenarios, an alternative architecture could be the best possible solution.
