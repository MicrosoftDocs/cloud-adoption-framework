# Refactor a Team Foundation Server deployment to Azure DevOps Services

>[!NOTE]
> With the release of Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2019, TFS was renamed to Azure DevOps Server. Most of this article will still refer to Team Foundation Server, for the sake of aligning with the actual product name of older versions of TFS and the intent of the article. For example, the Team Foundation Server migration tool, is now referred to as the Azure DevOps Server migration tool.

This article shows how the fictional company Contoso refactors its on-premises Visual Studio Team Foundation Server deployment by migrating it to Azure DevOps Services in Azure. In this scenario, the Contoso development team has used Team Foundation Server for team collaboration and source control for the past five years. Now, the team wants to move to a cloud-based solution for developer and testing work, and for source control. Azure DevOps Services plays a key role as the Contoso team moves to an Azure DevOps Services model and develops new cloud-native applications.

## Business drivers

The Contoso IT leadership team has worked closely with business partners to identify their future goals. Although the partners aren't overly concerned with developer tools and technologies, the team has captured these points:

- **Software:** Regardless of their core business, all companies are now essentially software companies, including Contoso. Business leadership is interested in how Contoso IT can help lead the company with new working practices for users and new experiences for its customers.
- **Efficiency:** Contoso wants to streamline its processes and remove unnecessary procedures for developers and users. Doing so will allow the company to deliver on customer requirements more efficiently. The business needs Contoso IT to move quickly, without wasting time or money.
- **Agility:** To enable success in a global economy, Contoso needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react more quickly to changes in the marketplace, and mustn't become a business blocker.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has the following goals for its migration to Azure DevOps Services:

- Use a tool to migrate data to the cloud with few manual processes.
- Migrate work item data and history for the past year.
- Maintain all current system assignments, and don't create new user names and passwords.
- For source control, move away from Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) to Git.
- Transition to Git during downtime, when all work will be halted as the code base shifts. The transition to Git is a tip migration that imports only the latest version of the source code. Only the current main branch history will be available after the move.
- Retain access to Team Foundation Server after the move to Azure DevOps Services and do testing before doing a full move.
- Start with a collection that has only a few projects.
- Because Team Foundation Server collections have a one-to-one relationship with Azure DevOps Services organizations, they have multiple URLs. This model matches its current model of separation for code bases and projects.

## Proposed architecture

- Contoso will move its Team Foundation Server projects to the cloud, and will no longer host its projects or source control on-premises.
- Team Foundation Server will be migrated to Azure DevOps Services.
- Currently, Contoso has one Team Foundation Server collection, named `ContosoDev`, which will be migrated to an Azure DevOps Services organization called `contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com`.
- The projects, work items, bugs, and iterations from the last year will be migrated to Azure DevOps Services.
- Contoso will use its Microsoft Entra instance, which it set up when it [deployed its Azure infrastructure](../azure-migration-guide/ready-alz.md) at the beginning of the migration planning.

:::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram of the proposed architecture.":::

## Migration process

The general migration process illustrated in this article is as follows:

1. Upgrade the Team Foundation Server implementation to a supported level.

   Contoso is currently running Team Foundation Server 2017 Update 3. However, to use database migration it needs to run a supported version with the latest updates. Although it's no longer supported as an upgrade version, in this fictitious example the Contoso admin team upgrades to Team Foundation Server 2018 upgrade 3.
   
   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > See [Migrate data from Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/migrate/migration-overview) for the list of versions of Azure DevOps Server (formerly known as Team Foundation Services) supported for migration. For upgrade assistance, see [Upgrade your deployment to the latest version of Azure DevOps Server](/azure/devops/server/upgrade/get-started), and be sure to select your version in the upper left Version dropdown. 
   >
   > For a complete discussion supported versions upgrading, refer to "Chapter 3: Upgrade" of the guide included in the migration tool, downloaded later in section "Step 3: Validate the Team Foundation Server collection".

1. Run the Team Foundation Server migration tool and validate its collection.

1. Build a set of preparation files, and then do a migration dry run for testing.

1. Run a full migration, which includes work items, bugs, sprints, and code.

1. Move the code from TFVC to Git.

:::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migration-process.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Contoso migration process.":::

## Prerequisites

To run this scenario, Contoso must meet the following prerequisites:

#### Azure subscriptions

Contoso set up its subscriptions as described in [Manage subscriptions](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md#manage-subscriptions):

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- If you create a free account, you're the admin of your subscription and can perform all actions.
- If you use an existing subscription and you're not the admin, work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.
- If you need more granular permissions, see [Manage Azure Site Recovery access with role-based access control](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control).

#### Azure infrastructure

Contoso set up its Azure infrastructure as described in [Deploy a migration infrastructure](../azure-migration-guide/ready-alz.md).

#### On-premises Team Foundation Server instance

In this fictitiouis example, the on-premises instance needs to either run Team Foundation Server 2018 upgrade 3 or be upgraded to it as part of this process.

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso admins complete the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Create an Azure Storage account**. This storage account is used during the migration process.
> - **Step 2: Upgrade Team Foundation Server**. Upgrade the deployment to a version of Azure DevOps Server that supports migration.
> - **Step 3: Validate the Team Foundation Server collection**. Validate the Team Foundation Server collection in preparation for the migration.
> - **Step 4: Build the migration files**. Create the migration files by using the Team Foundation Server migration tool.
> - **Step 5: Migrate to Azure DevOps Services**. With the preparation complete, Contoso admins can focus on migration.

## Step 1: Create an Azure Storage account

1. In the Azure portal, create a storage account named `contosodevmigration`.
1. Place the account in the secondary region (**Central US**) to use for failover. Use a standard account with locally redundant storage.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/storage1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Create storage account** pane.":::

## Step 2: Upgrade Team Foundation Server

Upgrade the Team Foundation Server instance to a version of Azure DevOps Server that supports migration, using the following general steps. In all cases, be sure to select your version in the upper left Version dropdown:

1. Review [Upgrade your deployment to the latest version of Azure DevOps Server](/azure/devops/server/upgrade/get-started). 
1. Refer to [Azure DevOps Server Downloads](/azure/devops/server/download/azuredevopsserver) for the latest downloads.
1. Verify the [Requirements for Azure DevOps on-premises](/azure/devops/server/requirements). 
2. Read the [release notes](/azure/devops/server/release-notes).

The following is an example of the steps the Contoso admins took to upgrade a server to Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 3:

1. Back up the Team Foundation Server instance, which is running on a VMware virtual machine (VM), and take a VMware snapshot.

   The Team Foundation Server installer starts.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Getting Started page for upgrading Team Foundation Server.":::

2. Choose the installation location. The installer requires internet access.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server installation site in Visual Studio.":::

    After the installation finishes, the Server Configuration Wizard starts.

3. On the **Welcome** page, select **Next** to continue.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 2 configuration wizard.":::

4. After you review and accept the Server Configuration Wizard settings, it completes the upgrade.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server Configuration Wizard upgrade progress pane.":::

5. Verify the Team Foundation Server installation by reviewing the projects, work items, and code.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Product backlog** pane for verifying the Team Foundation Server installation.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some Team Foundation Server upgrades need to run the Configure Features Wizard after the upgrade finishes. For more information, see [Configure features after an upgrade](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/upgrade/configure-features-after-upgrade?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true&viewFallbackFrom=vsts).

**See also:**

Learn about [upgrading Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/server/upgrade/get-started).

## Step 3: Validate the Team Foundation Server collection

Contoso admins run the Team Foundation Server migration tool against the `contosodev` collection database to validate it before migration:

1. Download and unzip the [Team Foundation Server migration tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54274). The download page provides 3 .zip files containing the migration tool, for the 3 latest supported versions. Refer to the admin console to verify the version you're currently running.

    Here's the version information and download selections used by the Contoso admins, at the time of their migration:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server pane for verifying the product version.":::

1. Run the migration tool to do the validation by specifying the URL of the project collection. For example:

    `TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev`

    In this example, the migration tool displays an error.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a validation error in the Team Foundation Server migration tool.":::

1. Locate the log files in the `Logs` folder.

   A log file is generated for each major validation. `TfsMigration.log` holds the main information.

1. In the log file, find this identity validation entry:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the error found during identity validation.":::

1. Enter `TfsMigrator validate /help` on the command line.

1. Run the validation command again, including parameters for the project collection and tenant domain name: `TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com`.

1. In the Microsoft Entra sign-in window that appears, enter the credentials of a Contoso admin user.

   If the validation passes, the migration tool confirms it.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection9.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that validation has passed.":::

## Step 4: Build the migration files

Now that the validation is complete, Contoso admins use the Team Foundation Server migration tool to build the migration files.

1. Run the `prepare` command with the migration tool:

    `TfsMigrator prepare /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com /accountRegion:cus`

    The `prepare` command does the following tasks:
    - Scans the collection to find a list of all users and then populates the identify map log (`IdentityMapLog.csv`).
    - Prepares the connection to Microsoft Entra ID to find a match for each identity.
    - Finds the matching identities and marks them as **Active**. The `prepare` command does so because the Contoso admins have already deployed Microsoft Entra ID and synchronized it by using Microsoft Entra Connect.

1. In the Microsoft Entra sign-in window that appears, enter the credentials of a Contoso admin user.

    After the preparation completes, the migration tool reports that the import files have been generated successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the migration tool, showing that collection validation is successful.":::

1. Verify that both the `IdentityMapLog.csv` file and the `import.json` file were created in a new folder on your machine.

   The `import.json` file provides import settings. It includes information such as the organization name and storage account details. Most of the fields are populated automatically, but some fields require user input.

1. Open the `import.json` file and add the Azure DevOps Services organization name to be created, `contosodevmigration`.

   With this name, the Contoso Azure DevOps Services URL is `contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep5.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure DevOps Services organization name.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The organization must be created before the migration begins. It can be changed after the migration is completed.

1. Review the identity log map file, which shows the accounts brought into Azure DevOps Services during the import:

    - Active identities refer to identities that will become users in Azure DevOps Services after the import.
    - In Azure DevOps Services, these identities are licensed and displayed as users in the organization after migration.
    - The identities are marked as **Active** in the **Expected Import Status** column in the file. For example:

       :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the identity log map file, showing the accounts to be brought into Azure DevOps Services.":::

## Step 5: Migrate to Azure DevOps Services

With the preparation complete, Contoso admins can now focus on migration. After they run the migration, they can switch from using TFVC to Git for version control.

Before the Contoso admins start, they schedule downtime with the dev team, so that they can plan to take the collection offline for migration.

Follow this migration process:

1. **Detach the collection.** Because changes that occur during the import can't be imported, detach the collection and keep it detached until the import has been completed.

    When you detach a collection from the Team Foundation Server instance, a copy of that identity data is packaged with the collection for transport. Without this data, the identity portion of the import can't be executed.

    Identity data for the collection is stored in the configuration database for the Team Foundation Server instance while the collection is attached and online.

1. **Generate a backup.** Generate a backup that can be imported into Azure DevOps Services.

    The data-tier application component package (DACPAC) is a SQL Server feature that allows you to package database changes into a single file, and then deploy it to other instances of SQL.

    You can restore the backup directly to Azure DevOps Services, and use it as the packaging method for getting collection data to the cloud. Contoso admins use the `sqlpackage.exe` tool to generate the DACPAC. This tool is included in SQL Server Data Tools.

1. **Upload to storage.** After the DACPAC is created, upload it to Azure Storage.

   After the upload, a shared access signature (SAS) is generated to allow the Team Foundation Server migration tool access to the storage.

1. **Perform a dry-run import.** Complete the missing fields in the import file, including the DACPAC setting. To ensure that everything's working properly before the full migration, specify to perform a *dry-run* import.

    A dry-run import helps to test the collection migration. Dry runs have a limited life, and are deleted automatically after a set duration and before a production migration runs. A success email sent after the import finishes includes a note that informs Contoso when the dry run is deleted.

1. **Complete the production migration.** With the dry-run migration completed, do the final migration by updating the `import.json` file, and then running import again.

<!-- docutune:casing "Team Foundation Server Administration Console" -->

### Detach the collection

Before Contoso admins detach the collection, they do a local SQL Server instance backup and take a VMware snapshot of the Team Foundation Server instance:

1. In the Team Foundation Server Administration Console, select the collection to detach, **ContosoDev**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Team Project Collections** section of the Foundation Server Administration Console.":::

1. Select the **General** tab, and then select **Detach Collection**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Detach Collection** link in the Foundation Server Administration Console.":::

1. In the **Detach Team Project Collection** wizard, on the **Servicing Message** page, provide a message for users who might try to connect to projects in the collection.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Servicing Message** pane in the Detach Team Project Collection Wizard.":::

1. On the **Detach Progress** page, monitor the progress. When the process finishes, select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Detach Progress** pane in the Detach Team Project Collection Wizard.":::

1. On the **Readiness Checks** page, when the checks finish, select **Detach**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Readiness Checks** page in the Detach Team Project Collection Wizard.":::

1. After the collection has been successfully detached, select **Close**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Complete** page in the Detach Team Project Collection Wizard.":::

    The collection is no longer referenced in the Team Foundation Server Administration Console.

### Generate a DACPAC

Contoso admins create a backup, or DACPAC, to import into Azure DevOps Services.

- Contoso admins use the `sqlpackage.exe` utility in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to create the DACPAC. Multiple versions of `sqlpackage.exe` are installed with SQL Server Data Tools, located under folders with names like `120`, `130`, and `140`. It's important to use the right version to prepare the DACPAC.

- Team Foundation Server 2018 imports must use `sqlpackage.exe` from the *140* folder or higher. For `CONTOSOTFS`, this file is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\140`.

Contoso admins generate the DACPAC as follows:

1. Open a command prompt and go to the `sqlpackage.exe` location. To generate the DACPAC, run the following command:

    `SqlPackage.exe /sourceconnectionstring:"Data Source=SQLSERVERNAME\INSTANCENAME;Initial Catalog=Tfs_ContosoDev;Integrated Security=True" /targetFile:C:\TFSMigrator\Tfs_ContosoDev.dacpac /action:extract /p:ExtractAllTableData=true /p:IgnoreUserLoginMappings=true /p:IgnorePermissions=true /p:Storage=Memory`

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt, displaying the command for generating the DACPAC.":::

    The following message appears:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt, displaying a message that the database was successfully extracted and saved to a DACPAC file.":::

1. Verify the properties of the DACPAC file.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup3.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying the DACPAC file properties for verification.":::

### Upload the file to storage

After the Contoso admins create the DACPAC file, they upload it to the Azure Storage account:

1. Download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/).

1. In Storage Explorer, connect to the subscription and then search for and select the storage account created for the migration (`contosodevmigration`). Create a new blob container, `azuredevopsmigration`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Create Blob Container** link in Storage Explorer.":::

1. On the **Upload files** pane, in the **Blob type** dropdown list, specify **Block Blob** for the DACPAC file upload.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup7.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Upload files** pane in Storage Explorer.":::

1. After the file is uploaded, select the file name and then select **Generate SAS**. Expand the **Blob Containers** list under the storage account, select the container with the import files, and then select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup8.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Get Shared Access Signature** link in Storage Explorer.":::

1. On the **Shared Access Signature** page, accept the default settings and then select **Create**.

    These settings enable access for 24 hours.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup9.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Shared Access Signature** pane in Storage Explorer.":::

1. Copy the shared access signature URL, so that it can be used by the Team Foundation Server migration tool.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup10.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the URL of the shared access signature in Storage Explorer.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The migration must happen within the allowed time window or the permissions will expire. Do *not* generate an SAS key from the Azure portal. Keys that are generated from the portal are account-scoped and won't work with the import.

### Fill in the import settings

Previously in this article, Contoso admins partially filled in the import specification file, `import.json`. Now, they need to add the remaining settings.

Open the `import.json` file and complete the following fields:

- **Location:** Enter the location of the SAS key that was generated previously.
- **DACPAC:** Enter the name of the DACPAC file previously uploaded to the storage account, making sure to include the *.dacpac* extension.
- **ImportType:** Enter **DryRun**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/import1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the `import.json` file with the fields filled in.":::

### Perform a dry-run migration

Contoso admins perform a dry-run migration to make sure that everything's working as expected:

1. Open a command prompt, and then go to the `TfsMigrator` location (`C:\TFSMigrator`).

1. To verify the file is formatted properly and that the SAS key is working, validate the import file by running the following command:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly`

    The validation returns an error stating that the SAS key needs a longer period before it expires.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt displaying a validation error.":::

1. Use Azure Storage Explorer to create a new SAS key with the period before expiration set to seven days.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Explorer **Shared Access Signature** pane displaying the expiration date.":::

1. Update the `import.json` file and rerun the command: `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly`

    This time, the validation is completed successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt displaying a **Validation completed successfully** message.":::

1. Start the dry run by running the following command:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json`

    A message displays requesting confirmation to continue with the migration. Note the seven-day period after the dry run during which the staged data will be maintained.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the message asking Contoso to confirm that they want to continue with the migration.":::

1. In the Microsoft Entra sign-in window that appears, enter the credentials of a Contoso admin.

    A message displays confirming that the import has been started successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test6.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the import has started successfully.":::

1. After 15 minutes, the following information is displayed on the website:

     :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test7.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the collection is being restored.":::

1. When the migration finishes, sign in to Azure DevOps Services as a Contoso admin to ensure that the dry run worked properly. After authentication, enter your contact information as requested.

    After the projects have been migrated successfully, a notice near the top of the page warns that the dry-run account will be deleted in 15 days.

1. Open one of the projects, and then select **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This page verifies that the work item data has been migrated successfully, along with the identity.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test10.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services Work Items page, displaying all the migrated projects.":::

1. To confirm that the source code and history have been migrated, check your other projects and code.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test11.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services History page, showing that all the code and history have been migrated.":::

### Run the production migration

Now that the dry run is complete, the Contoso admins can start the production migration. They delete the dry run, update the import settings, and run import again:

1. In the Azure DevOps Services portal, delete the dry-run organization.

1. Update the `import.json` file to set `ImportType` to `ProductionRun`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services portal, with the ImportType field set to ProductionRun.":::

1. Start the migration by running the same command that you used for the dry run:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json`.

    A message displays asking to confirm the migration. It warns that data could be held in a secure location as a staging area for up to seven days.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Azure DevOps Services message warning that the migrated data could be held for up to seven days.":::

1. In the Microsoft Entra sign-in window that appears, enter the credentials of a Contoso admin.

    A message displays stating that the import has started successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Azure DevOps Services message that the import has been started successfully.":::

    After 15 minutes, the following information is displayed on the web site:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full5.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the data is being copied to the cloud.":::

1. After the migration finishes, sign in to Azure DevOps Services as a Contoso admin to ensure that the projects were migrated properly.

1. Open a project and select **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This page shows that the work item data has been migrated.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full7.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the work item data and identity have been migrated.":::

1. Confirm that the other work item data has been migrated.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full8.png" alt-text="Screenshot listing additional work item data to be confirmed.":::

1. Check the other projects and code to confirm that the source code and history have been migrated.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test11.png" alt-text="Screenshot listing additional project and source code migration to be confirmed.":::

### Move source control from TFVC to Git

After migration is complete, Contoso admins next need to move source code management from TFVC to Git. To do so, the admins import the source code that's currently in their Azure DevOps Services organization as Git repos in the same organization:

1. In the Azure DevOps Services portal, open one of the TFVC repos, **$/PolicyConnect**, and review it.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **$/PolicyConnect** repo in the Azure DevOps Services portal.":::

1. In the source **$/PolicyConnect** dropdown list, select **Import repository**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Import repository** link in the Azure DevOps Services portal.":::

1. In the **Source type** dropdown list, select **TFVC**. In the **Path** box, specify the path to the repo, and then select **Import**. Leave the **Migrate History** checkbox cleared.

    > Because TFVC and Git store version control information differently, we recommend that Contoso *not* migrate its repository history.

1. After the import finishes, review the code.

1. Repeat the process for the second repository, `$/smarthotelcontainer`.

1. After you've reviewed the source, the migration to Azure DevOps Services is done. Azure DevOps Services now becomes the source for all development within the teams involved in the migration.

## Clean up after migration

With the migration now complete, the Contoso team needs to do the following tasks:

- Review the [post-import](/azure/devops/migrate/migration-post-import?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true&viewFallbackFrom=vsts) article for information about additional import activities.
- Either delete the TFVC repos or place them in read-only mode. Don't use the code bases; instead, reference them for their history.

## Post-migration training

The Contoso team needs to provide Azure DevOps Services and Git training for relevant team members.
