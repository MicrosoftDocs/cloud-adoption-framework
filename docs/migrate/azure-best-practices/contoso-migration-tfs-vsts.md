# Refactor a Team Foundation Server deployment to Azure DevOps Services

This article shows how the fictional company Contoso refactors its on-premises Visual Studio Team Foundation Server deployment by migrating it to Azure DevOps Services in Azure. The Contoso development team has used Team Foundation Server for team collaboration and source control for the past five years. Now, the team wants to move to a cloud-based solution for dev and test work and for source control. Azure DevOps Services will play a role as the Contoso team moves to an Azure DevOps model and develops new cloud-native applications.

## Business drivers

The Contoso IT leadership team has worked closely with business partners to identify future goals. The partners aren't overly concerned with dev tools and technologies, but the team has captured these points:

- **Software**: Regardless of the core business, all companies are now software companies, including Contoso. Business leadership is interested in how IT can help lead the company with new working practices for users and new experiences for its customers.
- **Efficiency**: Contoso needs to streamline its processes and remove unnecessary procedures for developers and users. Doing so will allow the company to deliver on customer requirements more efficiently. The business needs IT to move quickly, without wasting time or money.
- **Agility**: To enable its success in a global economy, Contoso IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react more quickly to changes in the marketplace. IT must not get in the way or become a business blocker.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down the following goals for its migration to Azure DevOps Services:

- The team needs a tool to migrate its data to the cloud. Few manual processes should be needed.
- Work item data and history for the last year must be migrated.
- The team doesn't want to set up new user names and passwords. All current system assignments must be maintained.
- The team wants to move away from Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) to Git for source control.
- The transition to Git will be a tip migration that imports only the latest version of the source code. The transition will happen during a downtime, when all work will be halted as the code base shifts. The team understands that only the current master branch history will be available after the move.
- The team is concerned about the change and wants to test it before it does a full move. The team wants to retain access to Team Foundation Server even after the move to Azure DevOps Services.
- The team has multiple collections and, to better understand the process, it wants to start with one that has only a few projects.
- The team understands that Team Foundation Server collections are a one-to-one relationship with Azure DevOps Services organizations, so it will have multiple URLs. But this matches its current model of separation for code bases and projects.

## Proposed architecture

- Contoso will move its Team Foundation Server projects to the cloud, and it will no longer host its projects or source control on-premises.
- Team Foundation Server will be migrated to Azure DevOps Services.
- Currently, Contoso has one Team Foundation Server collection, named `ContosoDev`, which will be migrated to an Azure DevOps Services organization called `contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com`.
- The projects, work items, bugs, and iterations from the last year will be migrated to Azure DevOps Services.
- Contoso will use its Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instance, which it set up when it [deployed its Azure infrastructure](./contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) at the beginning of the migration planning.

![Diagram of the proposed architecture.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/architecture.png)

## Migration process

Contoso will complete the migration process as follows:

1. Significant preparation is required. First, Contoso must upgrade its Team Foundation Server implementation to a supported level. Contoso is currently running Team Foundation Server 2017 Update 3, but to use database migration it needs to run a supported 2018 version with the latest updates.
1. After Contoso upgrades, it will run the Team Foundation Server migration tool and validate its collection.
1. Contoso will build a set of preparation files and then perform a migration dry run for testing.
1. Contoso will then run another migration, this time a full migration that includes work items, bugs, sprints, and code.
1. After the migration, Contoso will move its code from TFVC to Git.

![Diagram of the Contoso migration process.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migration-process.png)

## Prerequisites

To run this scenario, Contoso needs to meet the following prerequisites:

| Requirements | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Azure subscription** | Contoso created subscriptions in an earlier article in this series. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). <br><br> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions. <br><br> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions. <br><br> If you need more granular permissions, see [Manage Site Recovery access with role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control). |
| **Azure infrastructure** | Contoso set up its Azure infrastructure as described in [Azure infrastructure for migration](./contoso-migration-infrastructure.md). |
| **On-premises Team Foundation Server instance** | The on-premises instance needs to either run Team Foundation Server 2018 upgrade 2 or be upgraded to it as part of this process. |

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso will complete the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Create an Azure storage account**. This storage account will be used during the migration process.
> - **Step 2: Upgrade Team Foundation Server**. Contoso will upgrade its deployment to Team Foundation Server 2018 upgrade 2.
> - **Step 3: Validate the Team Foundation Server collection**. Contoso will validate the Team Foundation Server collection in preparation for the migration.
> - **Step 4: Build the migration files**. Contoso will create the migration files by using the Team Foundation Server migration tool.

## Step 1: Create an Azure storage account

1. In the Azure portal, Contoso admins create a storage account (`contosodevmigration`).
1. They place the account in the secondary region, which they use for failover (`Central US`). They use a general-purpose standard account with locally redundant storage.

    ![Screenshot of the "Create storage account" pane.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/storage1.png)

<!-- docsTest:ignore "Server Configuration Wizard" "Configure Features Wizard" "Detach Team Project Collection Wizard" -->

## Step 2: Upgrade Team Foundation Server

Contoso admins upgrade the Team Foundation Server instance to Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 2. Before they start, they:

- Download [Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 2](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads).
- Verify the [hardware requirements](/azure/devops/server/requirements).
- Read the [release notes](/visualstudio/releasenotes/tfs2018-relnotes) and [upgrade gotchas](/azure/devops/server/upgrade/get-started#before-you-upgrade-to-tfs-2018).

They upgrade as follows:

1. To start, the admins back up their Team Foundation Server instance, which is running on a VMware virtual machine (VM), and they take a VMware snapshot.

    ![Screenshot of the "Getting Started" pane for upgrading Team Foundation Server.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade1.png)

1. The Team Foundation Server installer starts, and they choose the installation location. The installer needs internet access.

    ![Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server installation site in Visual Studio.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade2.png)

1. After the installation finishes, the Server Configuration Wizard starts.

    ![Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 2 configuration wizard.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade3.png)

1. After verification, the Server Configuration Wizard completes the upgrade.

     ![Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server configuration wizard upgrade progress pane.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade4.png)

1. The admins verify the Team Foundation Server installation by reviewing projects, work items, and code.

     ![Screenshot of the "Product backlog" pane for verifying the Team Foundation Server installation.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade5.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Some Team Foundation Server upgrades need to run the Configure Features wizard after the upgrade finishes. [Learn more](/azure/devops/reference/configure-features-after-upgrade?utm_campaign=vstsdataimportguide&utm_medium=guide&utm_source=ms&view=vsts).

## Step 3: Validate the Team Foundation Server collection

Contoso admins run the Team Foundation Server migration tool against the `contosodev` collection database to validate it before migration.

1. They download and unzip the [Team Foundation Server migration tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54274). It's important to download the version for the Team Foundation Server update that's running. The version can be checked in the admin console.

    ![Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server pane for verifying the product version.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection1.png)

1. They run the tool to perform the validation by specifying the URL of the project collection, as shown in the following command:

    `TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev`

    The tool shows an error.

    ![Screenshot of a validation error in the Team Foundation Server migration tool.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection2.png)

1. They locate the log files in the `Logs` folder, just before the tool location. A log file is generated for each major validation. `TfsMigration.log` holds the main information.

    ![Screenshot of the log file location in Team Foundation Server.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection3.png)

1. They find this entry, which is related to identity.

    ![Screenshot showing the error encountered during identity validation.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection4.png)

1. They run `TfsMigrator validate /help` at the command line, and they see that the command `/tenantDomainName` seems to be required to validate identities.

     ![Screenshot showing the command that is required to validate identities.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection5.png)

1. They run the validation command again and include this value and their Azure AD name, `TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com`.

    ![Screenshot of command prompt showing the correct command.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection7.png)

1. In the Azure AD sign-in window that opens, they enter the credentials of a global admin user.

     ![Screenshot of the Azure AD sign-in window with admin credentials.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection8.png)

1. The validation passes and is confirmed by the tool.

    ![Screenshot showing that validation has passed.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection9.png)

## Step 4: Build the migration files

With the validation complete, Contoso admins can use the Team Foundation Server migration tool to build the migration files.

1. They run the preparation step in the tool.

    `TfsMigrator prepare /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com /accountRegion:cus`

     ![Screenshot of the preparation command in the Team Foundation Server migration tool.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep1.png)

    The preparation step does the following:
    - Scans the collection to find a list of all users and then populates the identify map log (`IdentityMapLog.csv`).
    - Prepares the connection to Azure AD to find a match for each identity.
    - Contoso has already deployed Azure AD and synchronized it by using Azure AD Connect, so the prepare command should be able to find the matching identities and mark them as **Active**.

1. An Azure AD sign-in screen appears, and the admins enter the credentials of a global admin.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure AD sign-in window with admin credentials.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep2.png)

1. The preparation is completed, and the tool reports that the import files have been generated successfully.

    ![Screenshot of the migration tool, showing that collection validation is successful.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep3.png)

1. The admins can now see that both the *IdentityMapLog.csv* file and the *import.json* file have been created in a new folder.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep4.png)

1. The `import.json` file provides import settings. It includes information such as the desired organization name, and storage account details. Most of the fields are populated automatically. Some fields require user input. The admins open the file and add the Azure DevOps Services organization name to be created, `contosodevmigration`. With this name, the Contoso Azure DevOps Services URL will be `contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com`.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure DevOps Services organization name.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep5.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The organization must be created before the migration begins. It can be changed after the migration is completed.

1. The admins review the identity log map file, which shows the accounts that will be brought into Azure DevOps Services during the import.

    - Active identities refer to identities that will become users in Azure DevOps Services after the import.
    - In Azure DevOps Services, these identities will be licensed and displayed as users in the organization after migration.
    - The identities are marked as **Active** in the **Expected Import Status** column in the file.

    ![Screenshot of the identity log map file, showing the accounts to be brought into Azure DevOps Services.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep6.png)

## Step 5: Migrate to Azure DevOps Services

With the preparation completed, Contoso admins can focus on the migration. After they run the migration, they'll switch from using TFVC to Git for version control.

Before they start, the admins schedule downtime with the dev team, so that they can plan to take the collection offline for migration.

Here is the migration process they'll follow:

1. **Detach the collection**. Identity data for the collection resides in the configuration database for the Team Foundation Server instance while the collection is attached and online.

    When a collection is detached from the Team Foundation Server instance, a copy of that identity data is made and then packaged with the collection for transport. Without this data, the identity portion of the import can't be executed.

    We recommended that the collection stay detached until the import has been completed, because changes that occur during the import can't be imported.

1. **Generate a backup**. The next step is to generate a backup that can be imported into Azure DevOps Services. The data-tier application component package (DACPAC) is a SQL Server feature that allows database changes to be packaged into a single file and then deployed to other instances of SQL.

    The backup can also be restored directly to Azure DevOps Services, and it's used as the packaging method for getting collection data to the cloud. Contoso will use the `sqlpackage.exe` tool to generate the DACPAC. This tool is included in SQL Server Data Tools.

1. **Upload to storage**. After the DACPAC is created, the admins upload it to Azure Storage. After they've uploaded it, they get a shared access signature (SAS) to allow the Team Foundation Server migration tool access to the storage.
1. **Fill out the import**. Contoso can then complete the missing fields in the import file, including the DACPAC setting. To ensure that everything's working properly before the full migration, the admins will specify that they want to perform a _dry-run_ import.
1. **Perform a dry-run import**. A dry-run import helps them test the collection migration. Dry runs have a limited life, so they're deleted before a production migration runs. They're deleted automatically after a set duration. A note that informs Contoso when the dry run will be deleted is included in the success email that's sent after the import finishes. The team takes note and plans accordingly.
1. **Complete the production migration**. With the dry-run migration completed, Contoso admins do the final migration by updating the `import.json` file and then running import again.

<!-- docsTest:ignore "Team Foundation Server Administration Console" -->

### Detach the collection

Before they detach the collection, Contoso admins take a local SQL Server instance backup and a VMware snapshot of the Team Foundation Server instance.

1. In the Team Foundation Server Administration Console, the admins select the collection they want to detach, **ContosoDev**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Team Project Collections" section of the Foundation Server Administration Console.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate1.png)

1. They select the **General** tab and then select **Detach Collection**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Detach Collection" link in the Foundation Server Administration Console.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate2.png)

1. In the **Detach Team Project Collection** wizard, on the **Servicing Message** pane, the admins provide a message for users who might try to connect to projects in the collection.

    ![Screenshot of the "Servicing Message" pane in the Detach Team Project Collection wizard.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate3.png)

1. On the **Detach Progress** pane, they monitor progress. When the process finishes, they select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Detach Progress" pane in the Detach Team Project Collection wizard.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate5.png)

1. On the **Readiness Checks** pane, when the checks finish, they select **Detach**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Readiness Checks" pane in the Detach Team Project Collection wizard.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate4.png)

1. When the collection has been successfully detached, they select **Close** to finish up.

    ![Screenshot of the "Complete" pane in the Detach Team Project Collection wizard.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate6.png)

    The collection is no longer referenced in the Team Foundation Server Administration Console.

    ![Screenshot of the Team Foundation Server Administration Console, showing that the collection is no longer listed.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate7.png)

### Generate a DACPAC

Contoso admins create a backup, or DACPAC, to import into Azure DevOps Services.

- The admins use the `sqlpackage.exe` utility in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to create the DACPAC. There are multiple versions of `sqlpackage.exe` installed with SQL Server Data Tools, and they're located under folders with names like `120`, `130`, and `140`. It's important to use the right version to prepare the DACPAC.

- Team Foundation Server 2018 imports need to use *sqlpackage.exe* from the *140* folder or higher. For `CONTOSOTFS`, this file is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\140`.

Contoso admins generate the DACPAC as follows:

1. They open a command prompt and go to the `sqlpackage.exe` location. To generate the DACPAC, they run the following command:

    `SqlPackage.exe /sourceconnectionstring:"Data Source=SQLSERVERNAME\INSTANCENAME;Initial Catalog=Tfs_ContosoDev;Integrated Security=True" /targetFile:C:\TFSMigrator\Tfs_ContosoDev.dacpac /action:extract /p:ExtractAllTableData=true /p:IgnoreUserLoginMappings=true /p:IgnorePermissions=true /p:Storage=Memory`

    ![Screenshot of the command prompt, displaying the command for generating the DACPAC.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup1.png)

    The following message is displayed:

    ![Screenshot of the command prompt, displaying a message that the database was successfully extracted and saved to a DACPAC file.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup2.png)

1. They verify the properties of the DACPAC file.

    ![Screenshot displaying the DACPAC file properties for verification.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup3.png)

### Upload the file to storage

After the admins create the DACPAC file, they upload it to the Azure storage account.

1. They download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer).

    ![Screenshot of "Download Storage Explorer free."](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup5.png)

1. In Storage Explorer, the admins connect to their subscription and then search for and select the storage account they created for the migration (`contosodevmigration`). They create a new blob container, `azuredevopsmigration`.

    ![Screenshot of the "Create Blob Container" link in Storage Explorer.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup6.png)

1. On the **Upload files** pane, in the **Blob type** drop-down list, the admins specify **Block Blob** for the DACPAC file upload.

    ![Screenshot of the "Upload files" pane in Storage Explorer.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup7.png)

1. After they upload the file, they select the file name and then select **Generate SAS**. They expand the **Blob Containers** list under the storage account, select the container with the import files, and then select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Get Shared Access Signature" link in Storage Explorer.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup8.png)

1. On the **Shared Access Signature** pane, they accept the default settings and then select **Create**. This enables access for 24 hours.

    ![Screenshot of the "Shared Access Signature" pane in Storage Explorer.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup9.png)

1. They copy the shared access signature URL, so that it can be used by the Team Foundation Server migration tool.

    ![Screenshot of the URL of the shared access signature in Storage Explorer.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup10.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The migration must happen within the allowed time window or the permissions will expire. Do *not* generate an SAS key from the Azure portal. Keys that are generated from the portal are account-scoped and won't work with the import.

### Fill in the import settings

Earlier, Contoso admins partially filled in the import specification file, *import.json*. Now, they need to add the remaining settings.

They open the *import.json* file and complete the following fields:

- **Location**: They enter the location of the SAS key that was generated previously.
- **Dacpac**: They enter the name of the DACPAC file that they uploaded earlier to the storage account, making sure to include the *.dacpac* extension.
- **ImportType**: They enter **DryRun** for now.

![Screenshot of the "import.json" file with the fields filled in.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/import1.png)

### Perform a dry-run migration

Contoso admins perform a dry-run migration to make sure that everything's working as expected.

1. They open a command prompt and then go to the `TfsMigrator` location (`C:\TFSMigrator`).
1. They want to make sure that the file is formatted properly and that the SAS key is working. They validate the import file by running the following command:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly`

    The validation returns an error saying that the SAS key needs a longer period before it expires.

    ![Screenshot of the command prompt displaying a validation error.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test1.png)

1. They use Azure Storage Explorer to create a new SAS key with the period before expiration set to seven days.

    ![Screenshot of the Storage Explorer "Shared Access Signature" pane displaying the expiration date.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test2.png)

1. They update the `import.json` file and rerun the command. This time, the validation is completed successfully.

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly`

    ![Screenshot of the command prompt displaying a "Validation completed successfully" message.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test3.png)

1. They start the dry run by running the following command:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json`

    A message is displayed asking them to confirm that they want to continue with the migration. Note the seven-day period after the dry run during which the staged data will be maintained.

    ![Screenshot of the message asking Contoso to confirm that they want to continue with the migration.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test4.png)

1. The Azure AD sign-in window opens. Contoso admins sign in to Azure AD with admin permissions.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure AD sign-in window in Visual Studio.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test5.png)

    A message is displayed confirming that the import has been started successfully.

    ![Screenshot showing that the import has started successfully.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test6.png)

1. After about 15 minutes, the admins go to the website and see the following information:

     ![Screenshot showing that the collection is being restored.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test7.png)

1. After the migration finishes, a Contoso dev lead signs in to Azure DevOps Services to ensure that the dry run worked properly. After authentication, Azure DevOps Services needs a few details to confirm the organization.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services window requesting additional information from the Contoso team.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test8.png)

    The dev lead can see that the projects have been migrated successfully. A notice near the top of the page warns that the dry run account will be deleted in 15 days.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services interface, with a message warning that the dry run account will be deleted in 15 days.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test9.png)

1. The dev lead opens one of the projects and then selects **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This page verifies that the work item data has been migrated successfully, along with the identity.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services "Work Items" pane, displaying all the migrated projects.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test10.png)

1. To confirm that the source code and history have been migrated, the dev lead checks other projects and code.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services "History" pane, showing that all the code and history have been migrated.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test11.png)

### Run the production migration

Now that the dry run is complete, Contoso admins move on to the production migration. They delete the dry run, update the import settings, and run import again.

1. In the Azure DevOps Services portal, they delete the dry-run organization.
1. They update the `import.json` file to set the **ImportType** to **ProductionRun**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure DevOps Services portal, with the ImportType field set to ProductionRun.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full1.png)

1. As they did for the dry run, they start the migration by running the following command:

    `TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json`.

    A message is displayed asking the admins to confirm the migration. It warns that data could be held in a secure location as a staging area for up to seven days.

    ![Screenshot of an Azure DevOps Services message warning that the migrated data could be held for up to seven days.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full2.png)

1. In the Azure AD sign-in window, they specify a Contoso admin sign-in.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure AD sign-in window in Visual Studio.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full3.png)

    A message is displayed that the import has started successfully.

    ![Screenshot of an Azure DevOps Services message that the import has been started successfully.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full4.png)

1. After about 15 minutes, the admins go to the website and see the following information:

    ![Screenshot showing that the data is being copied to the cloud.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full5.png)

1. After the migration finishes, a dev lead signs into Azure DevOps Services to ensure that the migration worked properly. After signing in, the dev lead can see that projects have been migrated.

    ![Screenshot showing that the projects have been migrated.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full6.png)

1. The dev lead opens one of the projects and selects **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This shows that the work item data has been migrated, along with the identity.

    ![Screenshot showing that the work item data and identity have been migrated.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full7.png)

1. The dev lead checks to confirm that other work item data has been migrated.

    ![Screenshot listing additional work item data to be confirmed.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full8.png)

1. To confirm that the source code and history have been migrated, the dev lead checks other projects and code.

    ![Screenshot listing additional project and source code migration to be confirmed.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full9.png)

### Move source control from TFVC to Git

With the migration now completed, Contoso admins want to move source code management from TFVC to Git. The admins need to import the source code that's currently in their Azure DevOps Services organization as Git repos in the same organization.

1. In the Azure DevOps Services portal, they open one of the TFVC repos, `$/PolicyConnect`, and review it.

    ![Screenshot of the "$/PolicyConnect" repo in the Azure DevOps Services portal.](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git1.png)

1. In the source **$/PolicyConnect** drop-down list, they select **Import repository**.

1. In the **Source type** drop-down list, they select **TFVC**. In the **Path** box, they specify the path to the repo, and then select **Import**. They decide to leave the **Migrate History** check box cleared.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because TFVC and Git store version control information differently, we recommend that Contoso *not* migrate its repository history. This is the approach that Microsoft took when we migrated Windows and other products from centralized version control to Git.

1. After the import finishes, the admins review the code.

1. They repeat the process for the second repository, `$/smarthotelcontainer`.

1. After the dev lead reviews the source, they agree that the migration to Azure DevOps Services is done. Azure DevOps Services now becomes the source for all development within the teams involved in the migration.

For more information, see [Import repositories from TFVC to Git](/azure/devops/repos/git/import-from-TFVC?view=vsts).

## Clean up after migration

With the migration now complete, the Contoso team needs to do the following:

- Review the [post-import](/azure/devops/articles/migration-post-import?view=vsts) article for information about additional import activities.
- Either delete the TFVC repos or place them in read-only mode. The code bases must not be used, but they can be referenced for their history.

## Post-migration training

The Contoso team will need to provide Azure DevOps Services and Git training for relevant team members.
