# Application migration patterns and examples

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework provides examples of several common migration scenarios, demonstrating how you can migrate on-premises infrastructure to the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-azure) cloud.

## Introduction

Azure provides access to a comprehensive set of cloud services. As developers and IT professionals, you can use these services to build, deploy, and manage applications on a range of tools and frameworks, through a global network of data centers. As your business faces challenges associated with the digital shift, the Azure cloud helps you to figure out how to optimize resources and operations, engage with your customers and employees, and transform your products.

However, Azure recognizes that even with all the advantages that the cloud provides in terms of speed and flexibility, minimized costs, performance, and reliability, many organizations are going to need to run on-premises data centers for some time to come. In response to cloud adoption barriers, Azure provides a hybrid cloud strategy that builds bridges between your on-premises data centers, and the Azure public cloud. For example, using Azure cloud resources like Azure Backup to protect on-premises resources, or using Azure analytics to gain insights into on-premises workloads.

As part of the hybrid cloud strategy, Azure provides growing solutions for migrating on-premises apps and workloads to the cloud. With simple steps, you can comprehensively assess your on-premises resources to figure out how they'll run in the Azure cloud. Then, with a deep assessment in hand, you can confidently migrate resources to Azure. When resources are up and running in Azure, you can optimize them to retain and improve access, flexibility, security, and reliability.

## Migration patterns

Strategies for migration to the cloud fall into four broad patterns: rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or rebuild. The strategy you adopt depends on your business drivers and migration goals. You might adopt multiple patterns. For example, you could choose to rehost simple apps, or apps that aren't critical to your business, but rearchitect apps that are more complex and business-critical. Let's look at these patterns.

**Pattern** | **Definition** | **When to use**
--- | --- | ---
**Rehost** | Often referred to as a _lift and shift_ migration. This option doesn't require code changes, and allows you to migrate your existing apps to Azure quickly. Each app is migrated as is, to reap the benefits of the cloud, without the risk and cost associated with code changes. | When you need to move apps quickly to the cloud.<br/><br/> When you want to move an app without modifying it.<br/><br/> When your apps are designed so that they can take advantage of [Azure IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas) scalability after migration.<br/><br/> When apps are important to your business, but you don't need immediate changes to app capabilities.
**Refactor** | Often referred to as "repackaging," refactoring requires minimal changes to apps, so that they can connect to [Azure PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas), and use cloud offerings.<br/><br/> For example, you could migrate existing apps to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).<br/><br/> Or, you could refactor relational and nonrelational databases into options such as Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB. | If your app can easily be repackaged to work in Azure.<br/><br/> If you want to apply innovative DevOps practices provided by Azure, or you're thinking about DevOps using a container strategy for workloads.<br/><br/> For refactoring, you need to think about the portability of your existing code base, and available development skills.
**Rearchitect** | Rearchitecting for migration focuses on modifying and extending app functionality and the code base to optimize the app architecture for cloud scalability.<br/><br/> For example, you could break down a monolithic application into a group of microservices that work together and scale easily.<br/><br/> Or, you could rearchitect relational and nonrelational databases to a fully managed database solution, such as Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB. | When your apps need major revisions to incorporate new capabilities, or to work effectively on a cloud platform.<br/><br/> When you want to use existing application investments, meet scalability requirements, apply innovative DevOps practices, and minimize use of virtual machines.
**Rebuild** | Rebuild takes things a step further by rebuilding an app from scratch using Azure cloud technologies.<br/><br/> For example, you could build green-field apps with [cloud-native](https://azure.com/cloudnative) technologies like Azure Functions, Azure AI, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, and Azure Cosmos DB. | When you want rapid development, and existing apps have limited functionality and lifespan.<br/><br/> When you're ready to expedite business innovation (including DevOps practices provided by Azure), build new applications using cloud-native technologies, and take advantage of advancements in AI, Blockchain, and IoT.

## Migration example articles

This section provides examples of several common migration scenarios. Each example includes background information and detailed deployment scenarios that illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure and assess the suitability of on-premises resources for migration. More articles will be added to this section over time.

![Common migration/modernization projectsâ€‹](./media/migration-patterns.png)

*Common migration and modernization project categories.*

The articles in the series are summarized below.

- Each migration scenario is driven by slightly different business goals that determine the migration strategy.
- For each deployment scenario, we provide information about business drivers and goals, a proposed architecture, steps to perform the migration, and recommendation for cleanup and next steps after migration is complete.
