# Overview of application migration examples for Azure

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework provides examples of several common migration scenarios and demonstrates how you can migrate on-premises infrastructure to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-azure/).

## Introduction

Azure provides access to a comprehensive set of cloud services. As developers and IT professionals, you can use these services to build, deploy, and manage applications on a range of tools and frameworks through a global network of datacenters. As your business faces challenges associated with the digital shift, the Azure platform helps you to determine how to:

- Optimize resources and operations.
- Engage with your customers and employees.
- Transform your products.

The cloud provides advantages for speed and flexibility, minimized costs, performance, and reliability. However, many organizations might need to continue to run on-premises datacenters. In response to cloud adoption barriers, Azure provides a hybrid cloud strategy that builds bridges between your on-premises datacenters and the Azure public cloud. An example is using Azure cloud resources like Azure Backup to protect on-premises resources or Azure analytics to gain insights into on-premises workloads.

As part of the hybrid cloud strategy, Azure provides growing solutions for migrating on-premises applications and workloads to the cloud. With simple steps, you can comprehensively assess your on-premises resources to determine how they'll run in the Azure platform. With a deep assessment in hand, you can confidently migrate resources to Azure. When resources are up and running in Azure, you can optimize them to retain and improve access, flexibility, security, and reliability.

## Migration patterns

Strategies for migration to the cloud fall into four broad patterns: rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or rebuild. The strategy you adopt depends on your business drivers and migration goals. You might adopt multiple patterns. For example, you could choose to rehost noncritical applications while rearchitecting applications that are more complex and business-critical. Let's look at these patterns.

| Pattern | Definition | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rehost** | Often referred to as a lift-and-shift migration, this option doesn't require code changes. You can use it to migrate your existing applications to Azure quickly. Each application is migrated as is to reap the benefits of the cloud without the risk and cost associated with code changes. | - When you need to move applications quickly to the cloud <br>- When you want to move an application without modifying it <br>- When your applications are designed to take advantage of [Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/) scalability after migration. <br>- When applications are important to your business, but you don't need to immediately change application capabilities. |
| **Refactor** | Often referred to as a "repackaging," refactoring requires minimal changes to applications so that they can connect to [Azure platform as a service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/) and use cloud offerings. </br></br>For example, you could migrate existing applications to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Or, you could refactor relational and nonrelational databases into options such as Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB. | - If your application can easily be repackaged to work in Azure <br>- If you want to apply innovative DevOps practices provided by Azure, or if you're thinking about DevOps using a container strategy for workloads <br>- For refactoring, you need to think about the portability of your existing code base and available development skills. |
| **Rearchitect** | Rearchitecting for migration focuses on modifying and extending application functionality and the code base to optimize the application architecture for cloud scalability. </br></br>For example, you could break down a monolithic application into a group of microservices that work together and scale easily. You could also rearchitect relational and nonrelational databases to a fully managed database solution, such as SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB. | - When your applications need major revisions to incorporate new capabilities or to work effectively on a cloud platform <br>- When you want to use existing application investments, meet scalability requirements, apply innovative DevOps practices, and minimize use of virtual machines |
| **Rebuild** | Rebuild takes things a step further by rebuilding an application from scratch using Azure cloud technologies. </br></br> For example, you could build greenfield applications with [cloud-native](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloudnative/) technologies like Azure Functions, AI, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Cosmos DB. | - When you want rapid development, and existing applications have limited functionality and lifespan <br>- When you're ready to expedite business innovation (including DevOps practices provided by Azure), build new applications using cloud-native technologies, and take advantage of advancements in AI, blockchain, and IoT. |

## Migration example articles

This section provides examples of several common migration scenarios. Each example includes background information and detailed deployment scenarios. These scenarios illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure and assess the suitability of on-premises resources for migration. More articles will be added to this section over time.

This series focuses on each migration scenario, which is driven by slightly different business goals to determine the migration strategy. For each deployment scenario, we provide information about:

- Business drivers and goals.
- A proposed architecture.
- Steps to perform the migration.
- Recommendations for cleanup and next steps after migration is finished.
