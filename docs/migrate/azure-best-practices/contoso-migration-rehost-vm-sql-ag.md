# Rehost an application by migrating it to Azure VMs and SQL Server Always On availability groups

This article demonstrates how the fictional company Contoso rehosts a two-tier Windows .NET application running on VMware virtual machines (VMs) as part of a migration to Azure. Contoso migrates the application front-end VM to an Azure VM. It migrates the application database to another Azure VM with SQL Server, running in a Windows Server failover cluster with SQL Server Always On availability groups.

The SmartHotel360 application used in this example is provided as open-source software. If you want to use it for your own testing purposes, download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360).

## Business drivers

The IT leadership team worked closely with business partners to understand what they want to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth.** Contoso is growing. As a result, there's pressure on the on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Increase efficiency.** Contoso wants to remove unnecessary procedures and streamline processes for developers and users. The company needs its IT to be fast, effective, and not waste time or money in delivering on customer requirements.
- **Increase agility.** Contoso IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must react faster than the changes in the marketplace to enable success in a global economy. IT mustn't get in the way or become a business blocker.
- **Scale.** As the business grows successfully, Contoso IT must provide systems that grow at the same pace.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team pinned down its goals for this migration. The company uses the following goals to determine the best migration method:

- After migration, the application in Azure should have the same performance capabilities as it does today in VMware. The application must remain as critical in the cloud as it's been on-premises.
- Contoso doesn't want to invest in this application. It's important to the business, but in its current form, the company simply wants to move it safely to the cloud.
- The on-premises database for the application has had availability issues. Contoso want to deploy it in Azure as a high-availability cluster with failover capabilities.
- Contoso wants to upgrade from its current SQL Server 2008 R2 platform to SQL Server 2017.
- Contoso doesn't want to use Azure SQL Database for this application and is looking for alternatives.

## Solution design

After Contoso decides on its goals and requirements, it designs and reviews a deployment solution and identifies the migration process. The company also identifies the Azure services that it wants to use for the migration.

### Current architecture

- The application is tiered across two VMs (`WEBVM` and `SQLVM`).
- The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host `contosohost1.contoso.com` (version 6.5).
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (`vcenter.contoso.com`) that runs on a VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (`contoso-datacenter`) with an on-premises domain controller (`contosodc1`).

### Proposed architecture

In this scenario:

- Contoso migrates the application front end `WEBVM` to an Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) VM.
  - The front-end VM in Azure deploys in the `ContosoRG` resource group (used for production resources).
  - It's located in the Azure production network (`VNET-PROD-EUS2`) in the primary region (`East US 2`).
- The team migrates the application database to an Azure VM running SQL Server.
  - It's located in Contoso's Azure database network (`PROD-DB-EUS2`) in the primary region (`East US 2`).
  - It's placed in a Windows Server failover cluster (with two nodes) that uses SQL Server Always On availability groups.
  - In Azure, the two SQL Server VM nodes in the cluster deploy in the `ContosoRG` resource group.
  - The VM nodes are located in the Azure production network (`VNET-PROD-EUS2`) in the primary region (`East US 2`).
  - VMs run Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2017 Enterprise edition. Contoso doesn't have licenses for this operating system. It uses an image in Azure Marketplace that provides the license as a charge to the company's Azure Enterprise Agreement commitment.
  - Apart from unique names, both VMs use the same settings.
- Contoso deploys an internal load balancer that listens for traffic on the cluster and directs it to the appropriate cluster node.
  - The internal load balancer deploys in `ContosoNetworkingRG` (that's for networking resources).
- After the migration completes, the team decommissions the on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter.

    ![Screenshot that shows a diagram of the scenario architecture.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/architecture.png)

### Database considerations

As part of the solution design process, Contoso did a feature comparison between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server. The following considerations helped the company decide to use an Azure IaaS VM running SQL Server:

- Using an Azure VM running SQL Server seems to be an optimal solution if Contoso needs to customize the operating system or the database server. This solution also works if Contoso might want to colocate and run third-party applications on the same VM.

### Solution review

Contoso evaluates its proposed design by putting together a list of pros and cons.

| Consideration | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Pros** | Moving `WEBVM` to Azure without changes makes the migration simple. <br><br> The SQL Server tier runs on SQL Server 2017 and Windows Server 2016, which retires the current Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system. Running SQL Server 2017 supports Contoso's technical requirements and goals. IT provides 100 percent compatibility while moving away from SQL Server 2008 R2. <br><br> Contoso takes advantage of its investment in Software Assurance by using the Azure Hybrid Benefit. <br><br> A high-availability SQL Server deployment in Azure provides fault tolerance so that the application data tier is no longer a single point of failover. |
| **Cons** | `WEBVM` runs Windows Server 2008 R2. Azure supports the operating system for specific roles (July 2018). To learn more, see [Microsoft server software support for Azure Virtual Machines](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/server-software-support). <br><br> The web tier of the application remains a single point of failover. <br><br> Contoso needs to continue supporting the web tier as an Azure VM rather than moving to a managed service such as Azure App Service. <br><br> With the chosen solution, Contoso needs to continue managing two SQL Server VMs rather than moving to a managed platform, such as Azure SQL Managed Instance. In addition, with Software Assurance, Contoso could exchange its existing licenses for discounted rates on Azure SQL Managed Instance. |

Learn more about [Azure Migrate pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-migrate/). |

## Migration process

The Contoso admin migrates the application VMs to Azure.

- Migrate the front-end VM to Azure VM by using Azure Migrate:
  - As a first step, prepare and set up Azure components and prepare the on-premises VMware infrastructure.
  - With everything prepared, start replicating the VM.
  - After you enable replication and it's working, migrate the VM by using Azure Migrate.
- After you verify the database, migrate the database to a SQL Server cluster in Azure by using Azure Database Migration Service.
  - As a first step, provision SQL Server VMs in Azure, set up the cluster and an internal load balancer, and configure Always On availability groups.
  - With these measures in place, you migrate the database.
- After the migration, enable Always On availability groups for the database.

## Step 1: Prepare a SQL Server Always On availability group cluster

To set up the cluster:

1. Select the SQL Server 2017 Enterprise Windows Server 2016 image in the Azure Marketplace to create two SQL Server VMs.

    ![Screenshot that shows a SQL VM SKU.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/sql-vm-sku.png)

1. In **Create a virtual machine** > **Basics** configure the following options:

    - Create a new resource group named `ContosoRG`.
    - Name the first VM: `SQLAOG1`.
    - Select the primary region of `East US 2`.
    - Choose **Availability zone** from **Availability options**.
    - Select **Zone 1** and **Zone 2** under **Availability zone**. Choosing the zones automatically creates a second VM with the name of `SQLAOG2`.
    - Specify the machine credentials under **Administrator account**.
    <!--- - Create a new availability set (`SQLAOGAVSET`) with two fault domains and five update domains. Note to FTE author: This bullet step from the original article that used to appear under the Networking step below no longer works. There was a screenshot here originally, too. I updated the screenshot anyway (per the latest Azure UI) in case you need it later. The original screenshot was named sql-vm-settings.png. I've updated that screenshot to match the new UI, but it's not currently being used here because creating a new availability set no longer works when creating two VMs at one time.-->

1. In **Size**, start with `D2S v3` instances for both VMs. You can scale later as needed.
1. In **Disks**, enable SSD for the VM disk type, because these machines are business-critical.

   - Use managed disks because these VMs are critical databases for the application and using the Availability zone option requires it.

1. In **Networking**:

    - Place the machines in the database subnet (`PROD-DB-EUS2`) of the production network (`VNET-PROD-EUS2`) in the primary region (`East US 2`). 
    - Create an internal load balancer (`ILB-PROD-DB-EUS2-SQLAOG`) that listens for traffic and directs it to the appropriate node. <!---Note to FTE: this step needed to move up to this spot from Step three "Deploy load balancer" below because the UI now mandates a load balancer be selected before it can create the two VMs. -->

     ![Screenshot that shows a new load balancer.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/load-balancer-settings.png)

1. In **SQL Server settings**, limit SQL connectivity to the virtual network (private) on default port 1433. For authentication, use the same credentials as the on-site credentials (`contosoadmin`).

    ![Screenshot that shows SQL Server settings.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/sql-vm-db.png)

- Learn how to [configure VMs for different SQL Server SKUs](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial#create-sql-server-vms).

## Step 2: Deploy and set up the cluster

To deploy and set up the cluster:

1. Set up an Azure Storage account to act as the cloud witness.
1. Add the SQL Server VMs to the Active Directory domain in the Contoso on-premises datacenter.
1. Create the cluster in Azure.
1. Configure the cloud witness.
1. Enable SQL Always On availability groups.

### Set up a storage account as a cloud witness

To set up a cloud witness, Contoso needs an Azure Storage account that holds the blob file for cluster arbitration. The company can use the same storage account to set up cloud witness for multiple clusters.

To create a storage account:

1. Specify a recognizable name for the account (`contosocloudwitness`).
1. Deploy a general all-purpose account, with LRS.
1. Place the account in a third region (`South Central US`). The admin places the account outside the primary and secondary region so that it remains available during regional failure.
1. Place the account in the resource group that holds infrastructure resources, `ContosoInfraRG`.

    ![Screenshot that shows the cloud witness account name.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/witness-storage.png)

1. When Contoso creates the storage account, it generates primary and secondary access keys for it. The primary access key must create the cloud witness. The key appears under the storage account name > **Access keys**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the access key.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/access-key.png)

<!-- docutune:casing "Failover Cluster feature" -->

### Add SQL Server VMs to Contoso domain

1. Add `SQLAOG1` and `SQLAOG2` to the `contoso.com` domain.
1. On each VM, install the Windows Failover Cluster feature and tools.

### Set up the cluster

Before the Contoso admin sets up the cluster, they take a snapshot of the OS disk on each machine.

![Screenshot that shows the **Create snapshot** pane.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/snapshot.png)

1. Run a script to create the Windows failover cluster.

    ![Screenshot that shows a script to create the Windows failover cluster.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/create-cluster1.png)

1. After you create the cluster, verify that the VMs appear as cluster nodes.

     ![Screenshot that shows the created clusters.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/create-cluster2.png)

### Configure the cloud witness

1. Configure the cloud witness by using the **Quorum Configuration Wizard** in Failover Cluster Manager.
1. In the wizard, select the option to create a cloud witness with the storage account.

After the cloud witness configures, it appears in the Failover Cluster Manager snap-in.

![Screenshot that shows the configured cloud witness.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/cloud-witness.png)

### Enable SQL Server Always On availability groups

The Contoso admin can now enable Always On availability groups:

1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, enable **Always On availability groups** for the **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Enable Always On Availability Groups** checkbox.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/enable-always-on.png)

1. Restart the service for changes to take effect.

With Always On availability groups enabled, Contoso can set up the Always On availability group that protects the `SmartHotel360` database.

**Learn more**

- Read about [cloud witness and setting up a storage account for it](/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness).

- Get instructions for how to [set up a cluster and create an availability group](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial).

## Step 3: Deploy Azure Load Balancer

The Contoso admin must now deploy the internal load balancer they created (`ILB-PROD-DB-EUS2-SQLAOG`) when setting up the VMs. The load balancer sits in front of the cluster nodes, listens for traffic, and directs traffic to the appropriate node.

![Diagram that shows load balancing.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/architecture-lb.png)

To deploy the load balancer:

1. Open **Networking** > **Load balancing**, in Azure portal. 
1. Place the (`ILB-PROD-DB-EUS2-SQLAOG`) load balancer in the database subnet (`PROD-DB-EUS2`) of the production network (`VNET-PROD-EUS2`). <!---This step doesn't seem to work. The UI doesn't show this ability.-->
1. Assign it a static IP address (`10.245.40.100`). <!--- The UI doesn't show this ability to assign an IP address to the load balancer.-->
1. Deploy the load balancer as a networking element in the networking resource group `ContosoNetworkingRG`. <!---This step doesn't seem to work. The UI doesn't show this ability.-->

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Create load balancer** pane.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/lb-create.png)

After the admin deploys the internal load balancer, they create a back-end address pool, set up a health probe, and configure a load-balancing rule.

### Add a back-end pool

To distribute traffic to the VMs in the cluster, the Contoso admin sets up a back-end address pool that contains the IP addresses of the NICs for VMs that receives network traffic from the load balancer.

1. In the load balancer settings in the portal, add a back-end pool: `ILB-PROD-DB-EUS-SQLAOG-BEPOOL`.
1. Associate the pool with the availability set `SQLAOGAVSET`.
1. Add the VMs in the set (`SQLAOG1` and `SQLAOG2`) to the pool.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Add backend pool** screen.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/backend-pool.png)

### Create a health probe

The Contoso admin creates a health probe so that the load balancer can monitor the application health. The probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on how the VMs respond to health checks.

To create the probe:

1. Open the load balancer settings in the portal and creates a health probe: `SQLAlwaysOnEndPointProbe`.
1. Set the probe to monitor VMs on TCP port 59999.
1. Set an interval of 5 seconds between probes and a threshold of 2. If two probes fail, the VM is considered unhealthy.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Add health probe** screen.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/nlb-probe.png)

### Configure the load balancer to receive traffic

Now, the Contoso admin sets up a load balancer rule to define how traffic distributes to the VMs.

- The front-end IP address handles incoming traffic.
- The back-end IP pool receives the traffic.

To create the rule:

1. Open the load balancer settings in the portal and adds a new rule: `SQLAlwaysOnEndPointListener`.
1. Set a front-end listener to receive incoming SQL client traffic on TCP port 1433.
1. Specify the back-end pool to which traffic routes and the port on which VMs listen for traffic.
1. Enable Floating IP (Direct Server Return), which is required for SQL Server Always On.

    ![Screenshot that shows health probe settings.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/nlb-probe.png)

- Learn about how to [create a load balancer](/azure/load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-internal-portal).

## Step 4: Prepare Azure for Azure Migrate

Here are the Azure components that Contoso needs for deploying Azure Migrate:

- A virtual network in which VMs are located when they're migrated.
- An Azure Storage account to hold replicated data.

Set up the following components:

1. The company already created a network/subnet that it can use for Azure Migrate when it [deployed the Azure infrastructure](./contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag.md).

    - The SmartHotel360 application is a production application. Migrate `WEBVM` to the Azure production network (`VNET-PROD-EUS2`) in the primary region (`East US 2`).
    - Place `WEBVM` in the `ContosoRG` resource group, which handles production resources, and in the production subnet (`PROD-FE-EUS2`).

1. The Contoso admin creates an Azure Storage account (`contosovmsacc20180528`) in the primary region.

    - Use a general-purpose account with standard storage and LRS replication.

## Step 5: Prepare on-premises VMware for Azure Migrate

Here's what the Contoso admin prepares on-premises:

- An account on the vCenter Server or vSphere ESXi host to automate VM discovery.
- On-premises VM settings so that Contoso can connect to the replicated Azure VM after migration.

### Prepare an account for automatic discovery

Azure Migrate needs access to VMware servers to:

- Automatically discover VMs.
- Orchestrate replication and migration.
- Run operations such as creating disks, removing disks, and turning on VMs. These capabilities require a read-only account at the least.

To set up the account:

1. Create a role at the vCenter level.
1. Assign that role the required permissions.

### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after migration

After migration, Contoso wants to connect to the Azure VMs and let Azure manage the VMs. So the admin does the following tasks before migration:

1. For access over the internet:

    - Enable RDP or SSH on the on-premises VM before migration.
    - Ensure that TCP and UDP rules are added for the **Public** profile.
    - Check that RDP or SSH is allowed in the operating system firewall.

1. For access over Site-to-Site VPN:

    - Enable RDP or SSH on the on-premises VM before migration.
    - Check that RDP or SSH is allowed in the operating system firewall.
    - For Windows, set the operating system's SAN policy on the on-premises VM to **OnlineAll**.

1. Install the Azure agent:

    - [Azure Linux agent](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux)
    - [Azure Windows agent](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows)

1. Miscellaneous:

   - For Windows, there should be no Windows updates pending on the VM when triggering a migration. If there are, the Contoso admin won't be able to sign in to the VM until the update completes.
   - After migration, the admin can check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM. If it doesn't work, they should verify that the VM is running and review the [troubleshooting tips](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

**Learn more**

Learn how to [prepare VMs for migration](/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration).

## Step 6: Replicate the on-premises VMs to Azure

Before the Contoso admin runs a migration to Azure, they must set up and enable replication.

With discovery finished, the admin can begin replicating VMware VMs to Azure.

1. In the Azure Migrate project, go to **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**, and select **Replicate**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Replicate** option.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/select-replicate.png)

1. In **Replicate** > **Source settings** > **Are your machines virtualized?**, select **Yes, with VMware vSphere**.

1. In **On-premises appliance**, select the name of the Azure Migrate appliance that was set up, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Source settings** tab.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/source-settings.png)

1. In **Virtual machines**, select the machines to replicate.
    - If you ran an assessment for the VMs, you can apply VM sizing and disk type (premium/standard) recommendations from the assessment results. In **Import migration settings from an Azure Migrate assessment?**, select the **Yes** option.
    - If you didn't run an assessment or don't want to use the assessment settings, select the **No** option.
    - If you select to use the assessment, choose the VM group and assessment name.

    ![Screenshot that shows selecting assessments.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/select-assessment.png)

1. In **Virtual machines**, search for VMs as needed and check each VM to migrate. Then select **Next: Target settings**.

1. In **Target settings**, choose the subscription, and target region to which you'll migrate, and specify the resource group in which the Azure VMs reside after migration. 
1. In **Virtual Network**, select the Azure virtual network/subnet to which the Azure VMs are joined after migration.

1. In **Azure Hybrid Benefit**:

    - Select **No** if you don't want to apply Azure Hybrid Benefit. Then select **Next**.
    - Select **Yes** if you have Windows Server machines that are covered with active Software Assurance or Windows Server subscriptions, and want to apply the benefit to the machines you're migrating. Then select **Next**.

1. In **Compute**, review the VM name, size, OS disk type, and availability set. VMs must conform with [Azure requirements](/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#vmware-requirements).

    - **VM size:** If you're using assessment recommendations, the VM size dropdown list contains the recommended size. Otherwise, Azure Migrate picks a size based on the closest match in the Azure subscription. Alternatively, you can pick a manual size in **Azure VM size.**
    - **OS disk:** Specify the OS (boot) disk for the VM. The OS disk is the disk that has the operating system bootloader and installer.
    - **Availability set:** If the VM should be in an Azure availability set after migration, specify the set. The set must be in the target resource group you specify for the migration.

1. In **Disks**, choose whether the VM disks should be replicated to Azure. Then select the disk type (Standard SSD/HDD or Premium SSD) in Azure and select **Next**.
    - You can exclude disks from replication.
    - If disks are excluded, they won't be present on the Azure VM after migration.

1. In **Review + Start replication**, review the settings. Then select **Replicate** to start the initial replication for the servers.

> [!NOTE]
> You can update replication settings at any time before replication starts in **Manage** > **Replicating machines**. But you can't update the settings after replication starts.

## Step 7: Migrate the database by way of Azure Database Migration Service

The Contoso admin migrates the database by way of Azure Database Migration Service by following the [step-by-step migration tutorial](/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql). They can run online, offline, and hybrid (preview) migrations.

As a summary, you do the following tasks:

- Use the Premium pricing tier to create an Azure Database Migration Service instance that connects to the virtual network.
- Ensure that the instance can access the remote SQL Server by way of the virtual network. Ensure that all incoming ports are allowed: from Azure to SQL Server at the virtual network level, the network VPN, and the machine that hosts SQL Server.
- Configure the instance:
  - Create a migration project.
  - Add a source (on-premises database).
  - Select a target.
  - Select the databases to migrate.
  - Configure advanced settings.
  - Start the replication.
  - Resolve any errors.
  - Perform the final cutover.

## Step 8: Protect the database with SQL Server Always On

With the application database running on `SQLAOG1`, you can now protect it by using Always On availability groups. Configure SQL Server Always On by using SQL Server Management Studio and then assign a listener by using Windows clustering.

### Create an Always On availability group

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, select and hold (or right-click) **Always On High Availability** to start the **New Availability Group Wizard**.
1. In **Specify Options**, name the availability group `SHAOG`. In **Select Databases**, choose the `SmartHotel360` database.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Select Databases** pane.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/aog-1.png)

1. In **Specify Replicas**, add the two SQL nodes as availability replicas and configure them to provide automatic failover with synchronous commit.

     ![Screenshot that shows the **Replicas** tab.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/aog-2.png)

1. Configure a listener for the group (`SHAOG`) and port. Add the IP address of the internal load balancer as a static IP address (`10.245.40.100`).

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Create an availability group listener** option.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/aog-3.png)

1. In **Select Data Synchronization**, enable automatic seeding. With this option, SQL Server automatically creates secondary replicas for every database in the group, so you don't have to manually back up and restore them. After validation, the availability group is created.

1. In this example, Contoso runs into an issue when creating the group. The company isn't using Active Directory Windows integrated security and needs to grant permissions to the SQL login to create the Windows failover cluster roles.

    ![Screenshot that shows granting permissions to the SQL login.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/aog-5.png)

1. After the group is created, it appears in SQL Server Management Studio.

### Configure a listener on the cluster

As a last step in setting up the SQL deployment, configure the internal load balancer as the listener on the cluster and bring the listener online. You can use a script to do this task.

### Verify the configuration

With everything set up, Contoso now has a functional availability group in Azure that uses the migrated database. The admin verifies the configuration by connecting to the internal load balancer in SQL Server Management Studio.

## Step 9: Migrate the VM with Azure Migrate

The Contoso admin runs a quick test failover and then migrates the VM.

### Run a test migration

Running a test migration helps ensure that everything's working as expected before the migration.

1. Run a test failover to the latest available point in time (`Latest processed`).
1. Select **Shut down machine before beginning failover** so that Azure Migrate attempts to shut down the source VM before triggering the failover. Failover continues even if shutdown fails.
1. A test failover runs:

    - A prerequisites check runs to make sure all of the conditions required for migration are in place.
    - Failover processes the data so that an Azure VM is created. If the admin selected the latest recovery point, it creates a recovery point from the data.
    - The data that processes from the previous step creates the Azure VM.

1. After the failover finishes, the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal. Check that the VM is the appropriate size, that it's connected to the right network, and that it's running.
1. After verifying, clean up the failover and record and save any observations.

### Run a failover

1. After verifying that the test failover worked as expected, create a recovery plan for migration, and add `WEBVM` to the plan.

     ![Screenshot that shows the **Create recovery plan** pane.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/recovery-plan.png)

1. Run a failover on the plan and select the latest recovery point. Specify that Azure Migrate should try to shut down the on-premises VM before triggering the failover.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Failover** pane.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/failover1.png)

1. After the failover, verify that the Azure VM appears as expected in the Azure portal.

    ![Screenshot that shows an overview pane for the virtual machine.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/failover2.png)

1. After verifying the VM in Azure, complete the migration to finish the migration process, stop replication for the VM, and stop Azure Migrate billing for the VM.

    ![Screenshot that shows the **Complete migration** item.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/failover3.png)

### Update the connection string

As the final step in the migration process, the Contoso admin updates the connection string of the application to point to the migrated database running on the `SHAOG` listener. This configuration is changed on the `WEBVM` now running in Azure. This configuration is located in the `web.config` of the ASP.NET application.

1. Locate the file at `C:\inetpub\SmartHotelWeb\web.config` and change the name of the server to reflect the FQDN of the Always On availability group: `shaog.contoso.com`.

    ![Screenshot that shows the FQDN of the Always On availability group.](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-ag/failover4.png)

1. After you update and then save the file, restart IIS on `WEBVM`. Use `iisreset /restart` from a command prompt.
1. After IIS restarts, the application now uses the database running on the managed instance.

- Learn about [failing over to Azure](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-failover).

### Clean up after migration

After migration, the SmartHotel360 application runs on an Azure VM. The `SmartHotel360` database is located in the SQL Server cluster in Azure.

Now, finish these cleanup steps:

- Remove the on-premises VMs from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove the VMs from local backup jobs.
- Update internal documentation to show the new locations and IP addresses for VMs.
- Review any resources that interact with the decommissioned VMs. Update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.
- Add the two new VMs (`SQLAOG1` and `SQLAOG2`) to production monitoring systems.

### Review the deployment

With the migrated resources in Azure, you need to fully operationalize and secure its new infrastructure.

### Security

Your security team reviews the virtual machines `WEBVM`, `SQLAOG1`, and `SQLAOG2` to determine any security issues.

- Review the network security groups (NSGs) for the VM to control access. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the application can pass.
- Consider securing the data on the disk by using Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Key Vault.
- Evaluate transparent data encryption. Then enable it on the `SmartHotel360` database running on the new Always On availability group. Learn more about [transparent data encryption](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption).

For more information, see [Security best practices for IaaS workloads in Azure](/azure/security/fundamentals/iaas).

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

For business continuity and disaster recovery, take the following actions:

- Back up the data on the `WEBVM`, `SQLAOG1`, and `SQLAOG2` VMs by way of [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction) to keep the data safe.
- Learn how to use Azure Storage to back up SQL Server directly to Azure Blob Storage. Learn more about how to [use Azure Storage for SQL Server backup and restore](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/azure-storage-sql-server-backup-restore-use).
- Replicate the application VMs in Azure to a secondary region by using Site Recovery to keep your applications up and running. Learn more about how to [set up disaster recovery to a secondary Azure region for an Azure VM](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-quickstart).

### Licensing and cost optimization

- Contoso has existing licensing for its `WEBVM` and plans to take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit. Contoso converts the existing Azure VMs to take advantage of this pricing.
- Contoso uses [Azure Cost Management + Billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to ensure the company stays within budgets established by the IT leadership.

## Conclusion

In this article, Contoso rehosted the SmartHotel360 application in Azure by migrating the application front-end VM to Azure with Azure Migrate. Contoso migrated the application database to a SQL Server cluster provisioned in Azure by using Azure Database Migration Service and protected it in a SQL Server Always On availability group.
