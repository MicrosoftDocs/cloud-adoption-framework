# Refactor a Linux app to multiple regions using Azure App Service, Traffic Manager, and Azure Database for MySQL

This article shows how the fictional company Contoso refactors a two-tier Linux-based Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) app, migrating it from on-premises to Azure using Azure App Service with GitHub integration and Azure Database for MySQL.

osTicket, the service desk app used in this example is provided as open source. If you'd like to use it for your own testing purposes, you can download it from the [osTicket repo in GitHub](https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket).

## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with business partners to understand what they want to achieve:

- **Address business growth.** Contoso is growing and moving into new markets. It needs additional customer service agents.
- **Scale.** The solution should be built so that Contoso can add more customer service agents as the business scales.
- **Improve resiliency.** In the past, issues with the system affected internal users only. With the new business model, external users will be affected, and Contoso need the app up and running at all times.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for this migration, in order to determine the best migration method:

- The application should scale beyond current on-premises capacity and performance. Contoso is moving the application to take advantage of Azure's on-demand scaling.
- Contoso wants to move the app code base to a continuous delivery pipeline. As app changes are pushed to GitHub, Contoso wants to deploy those changes without tasks for operations staff.
- The application must be resilient with capabilities for growth and failover. Contoso wants to deploy the app in two different Azure regions, and set it up to scale automatically.
- Contoso wants to minimize database admin tasks after the app is moved to the cloud.

## Solution design

After pinning down their goals and requirements, Contoso designs and reviews a deployment solution, and identifies the migration process, including the Azure services that will be used for the migration.

## Current architecture

- The app is tiered across two VMs (OSTICKETWEB and OSTICKETMYSQL).
- The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5).
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (contoso-datacenter), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).

![Current architecture](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/current-architecture.png)

## Proposed architecture

Here's the proposed architecture:

- The web tier app on OSTICKETWEB will be migrated by building an Azure App Service in two Azure regions. Azure App Service for Linux will be implemented using the PHP 7.0 Docker container.
- The app code will be moved to GitHub, and the Azure App Service web app will be configured for continuous delivery with GitHub.
- Azure App Servers will be deployed in both the primary (East US 2) and secondary (Central US) region.
- Traffic Manager will be set up in front of the two web apps in both regions.
- Traffic Manager will be configured in priority mode to force the traffic through East US 2.
- If the Azure App Server in East US 2 goes offline, users can access the failed over app in Central US.
- The app database will be migrated to the Azure Database for MySQL service using Azure Database Migration Service (DMS). The on-premises database will be backed up locally, and restored directly to Azure Database for MySQL.
- The database will reside in the primary East US 2 region, in the database subnet (PROD-DB-EUS2) in the production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2):
- Since they're migrating a production workload, Azure resources for the app will reside in the production resource group **ContosoRG**.
- The Traffic Manager resource will be deployed in Contoso's infrastructure resource group **ContosoInfraRG**.
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

![Scenario architecture](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/proposed-architecture.png)

## Migration process

Contoso will complete the migration process as follows:

1. As a first step, Contoso admins set up the Azure infrastructure, including provisioning Azure App Service, setting up Traffic Manager, and provisioning an Azure Database for MySQL instance.
2. After preparing the Azure infrastructure, they migrate the database using Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
3. After the database is running in Azure, they up a GitHub private repository for Azure App Service with continuous delivery, and load it with the osTicket app.
4. In the Azure portal, they load the app from GitHub to the Docker container running Azure App Service.
5. They tweak DNS settings, and configure autoscaling for the app.

**Azure infrastructure** | Contoso set up their Azure infrastructure as described in [Azure infrastructure for migration](./contoso-migration-infrastructure.md).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso will complete the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Provision Azure App Service.** Contoso admins will provision web apps in the primary and secondary regions.
> - **Step 2: Set up Traffic Manager.** They set up Traffic Manager in front of the web apps, for routing and load balancing traffic.
> - **Step 3: Provision MySQL.** In Azure, they provision an instance of Azure Database for MySQL.
> - **Step 4: Migrate the database.** They migrate the database using Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
> - **Step 5: Set up GitHub.** They set up a local GitHub repository for the app web sites/code.
> - **Step 6: Deploy the web apps.** They deploy the web apps from GitHub.

## Step 1: Provision Azure App Service

Contoso admins provision two web apps (one in each region) using Azure App Service.

1. They create a web App resource in the primary East US 2 region (**osticket-eus2**) from the Azure Marketplace.
2. They put the resource in the production resource group **ContosoRG**.

    ![Azure App](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/azure-app1.png)

3. They create a new App Service plan in the primary region (**APP-SVP-EUS2**), using the standard size.

     ![Azure App](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/azure-app2.png)

4. They select a Linux OS with PHP 7.0 runtime stack, which is a Docker container.

    ![Azure App](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/azure-app3.png)

5. They create a second web app (**osticket-cus**), and Azure App Service plan for the Central US region.

    ![Azure App](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/azure-app4.png)

- Learn about [Azure App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/app-service-linux-intro).

## Step 2: Set up Traffic Manager

Contoso admins set up Traffic Manager to direct inbound web requests to the web apps running on the osTicket web tier.

1. They create a Traffic Manager resource (**osticket.trafficmanager.net**) from the Azure Marketplace. They use priority routing so that East US 2 is the primary site. They place the resource in their infrastructure resource group (**ContosoInfraRG**). Note that Traffic Manager is global and not bound to a specific location.

    ![Traffic Manager](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/traffic-manager1.png)

2. Now, they configure Traffic Manager with endpoints. They add the East US 2 web app as the primary site (**osticket-eus2**), and the Central US app as secondary (**osticket-cus**).

    ![Traffic Manager](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/traffic-manager2.png)

3. After adding the endpoints, they can monitor them.

    ![Traffic Manager](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/traffic-manager3.png)

- Learn about [routing traffic to a priority endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-configure-priority-routing-method).

## Step 3: Provision Azure Database for MySQL

Contoso admins provision a MySQL database instance in the primary East US 2 region.

1. In the Azure portal, they create an Azure Database for MySQL resource.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/mysql-1.png)

2. They add the name **contosoosticket** for the Azure database. They add the database to the production resource group **ContosoRG**, and specify credentials for it.
3. The on-premises MySQL database is version 5.7, so they select this version for compatibility. They use the default sizes, which match their database requirements.

     ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/mysql-2.png)

4. For **Backup Redundancy Options**, they select to use **Geo-Redundant**. This option allows them to restore the database in their secondary Central US region if an outage occurs. They can only configure this option when they provision the database.

    ![Redundancy](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/db-redundancy.png)

5. They set up connection security. In the database > **Connection Security**, they set up Firewall rules to allow the database to access Azure services.

6. They add the local workstation client IP address to the start and end IP addresses. This allows the web apps to access the MySQL database, along with the database client that's performing the migration.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/mysql-3.png)

## Step 4: Migrate the database

There are several ways to move the MySQL database. Each option requires you to create an Azure DB for MySQL instance for the target. Once created, you can perform the migration using two paths:

- 4a: Azure Database Migration Service
- 4b: MySQL Workbench backup and restore

### Step 4a: Migrate the database (Azure Database Migration Service)

Contoso admins migrate the database using Azure Database Migration Services using the [step-by-step migration tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-mysql-azure-mysql-online). They can perform online, offline, and hybrid (preview) migrations using MySQL 5.6 or 5.7.

> [!NOTE]
> MySQL 8.0 is supported in Azure Database for MySQL, but the DMS tool does not yet support this version.

As a summary, you must perform the following:

- Ensure all migration prerequisites are met:
  - MySQL server source must match the version that Azure Database for MySQL supports. Azure Database for MySQL supports - MySQL community edition, InnoDB engine and migration across source and target with same versions.
  - Enable binary logging in my.ini (Windows) or my.cnf (Unix). Failure to do this will cause `Error in binary logging. Variable binlog_row_image has value 'minimal'. Please change it to 'full'. For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873009` during the migration wizard.
  - The user must have `ReplicationAdmin` role.
  - Migrate the database schemas without foreign keys and triggers.
- Create a virtual network that connects via ExpressRoute or VPN to your on-premises network.
- Create an Azure Database Migration Service with a `Premium` SKU that is connected to the VNet.
- Ensure that the Azure Database Migration Service can access the MySQL database via the virtual network. This would entail ensuring that all incoming ports are allowed from Azure to MySQL at the virtual network level, the network VPN, and the machine that hosts MySQL.
- Run the Azure Database Migration Service Tool:
  - Create a migration project based on the **Premium SKU**.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-new-project.png)

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-new-project-02.png)

  - Add a source (on-premises database).

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-source.png)

  - Select a target.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-target.png)

  - Select the database(s) to migrate.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-databases.png)

  - Configure advanced settings.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-settings.png)

  - Start the replication and resolve any errors.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-monitor.png)
  
  - Perform the final cutover.
  
    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-cutover.png)

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-cutover-complete.png)

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-cutover-complete-02.png)
  
  - Reinstate any foreign keys and triggers.

  - Modify applications to use the new database.

    ![MySQL](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/migration-dms-cutover-apps.png)

### Step 4b: Migrate the database (MySQL Workbench)

1. They check the [prerequisites and downloads MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/?utm_source=tuicool).
2. They install MySQL Workbench for Windows in accordance with the [installation instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing.html). The machine on which they install must be accessible to the OSTICKETMYSQL VM, and Azure via the internet.
3. In MySQL Workbench, they create a MySQL connection to OSTICKETMYSQL.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench1.png)

4. They export the database as **osticket**, to a local self-contained file.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench2.png)

5. After the database has been backed up locally, they create a connection to the Azure Database for MySQL instance.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench3.png)

6. Now, they can import (restore) the database in the Azure Database for MySQL instance, from the self-contained file. A new schema (osticket) is created for the instance.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench4.png)

7. After data is restored, it can be queried using Workbench, and appears in the Azure portal.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench5.png)

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench6.png)

8. Finally, they need to update the database information on the web apps. On the MySQL instance, they open **Connection Strings**.

     ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench7.png)

9. In the strings list, they locate the web app settings, and select to copy them.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench8.png)

10. They open a Notepad window and paste the string into a new file, and update it to match the osticket database, MySQL instance, and credentials settings.

     ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench9.png)

11. They can verify the server name and login from **Overview** in the MySQL instance in the Azure portal.

    ![MySQL Workbench](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/workbench10.png)

## Step 5: Set up GitHub

Contoso admins create a new private GitHub repo and set up a connection to the osTicket database in Azure Database for MySQL. Then, they load the web app into Azure App Service.

1. They browse to the OsTicket software public GitHub repo, and fork it to the Contoso GitHub account.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github1.png)

2. After forking, they navigate to the **include** folder, and find the **ost-config.php** file.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github2.png)

3. The file opens in the browser and they edit it.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github3.png)

4. In the editor, they update the database details, specifically for **DBHOST** and **DBUSER**.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github4.png)

5. Then they commit the changes.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github5.png)

6. For each web app (**osticket-eus2** and **osticket-cus**), they modify the **Application settings** in the Azure portal.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github6.png)

7. They enter the connection string with the name **osticket**, and copy the string from notepad into the **value area**. They select **MySQL** in the dropdown list next to the string, and save the settings.

    ![GitHub](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/github7.png)

## Step 6: Configure the web apps

As the final step in the migration process, Contoso admins configure the web apps with the osTicket web sites.

1. In the primary web app (**osticket-eus2**), they open **Deployment option** and set the source to **GitHub**.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app1.png)

2. They select the deployment options.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app2.png)

3. After setting the options, the configuration shows as pending in the Azure portal.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app3.png)

4. After the configuration is updated and the osTicket web app is loaded from GitHub to the Docket container running the Azure App Service, the site shows as Active.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app4.png)

5. They repeat the above steps for the secondary web app (**osticket-cus**).
6. After the site is configured, it's accessible via the Traffic Manager profile. The DNS name is the new location of the osTicket app. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain#map-a-cname-record).

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app5.png)

7. Contoso wants a DNS name that's easy to remember. They create an alias record (CNAME) `osticket.contoso.com` that points to the Traffic Manager name, in the DNS on their domain controllers.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app6.png)

8. They configure both the **osticket-eus2** and **osticket-cus** web apps to allow the custom host names.

    ![Configure app](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/configure-app7.png)

### Set up autoscaling

Finally, they set up automatic scaling for the app. This ensures that as agents use the app, the app instances increase and decrease according to business needs.

1. In App Service **APP-SRV-EUS2**, they open **Scale Unit**.
2. They configure a new autoscale setting with a single rule that increases the instance count by one when the CPU percentage for the current instance is above 70% for 10 minutes.

    ![Autoscale](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/autoscale1.png)

3. They configure the same setting on **APP-SRV-CUS** to ensure that the same behavior applies if the app fails over to the secondary region. The only difference is that they set the default instance to 1 since this is for failovers only.

   ![Autoscale](./media/contoso-migration-refactor-linux-app-service-mysql/autoscale2.png)

## Clean up after migration

With migration complete, the osTicket app is refactored to running in an Azure App Service web app with continuous delivery using a private GitHub repo. The app's running in two regions for increased resilience. The osTicket database is running in Azure database for MySQL after migration to the PaaS platform.

For cleanup, Contoso needs to do the following:

- Remove the VMware VMs from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove the on-premises VMs from local backup jobs.
- Update internal documentation show new locations and IP addresses.
- Review any resources that interact with the on-premises VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.
- Reconfigure monitoring to point at the osticket-trafficmanager.net URL, to track that the app is up and running.

## Review the deployment

With the app now running, Contoso need to fully operationalize and secure their new infrastructure.

### Security

The Contoso security team reviewed the app to determine any security issues. They identified that the communication between the osTicket app and the MySQL database instance isn't configured for SSL. They will need to do this to ensure that database traffic can't be hacked. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-ssl).

### Backups

- The osTicket web apps don't contain state data and thus don't require backup.
- They don't need to configure backup for the database. Azure Database for MySQL automatically creates server backups and stores. They selected to use geo-redundancy for the database, so it's resilient and production-ready. Backups can be used to restore your server to a point-in-time. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-backup).

### Licensing and cost optimization

- There are no licensing issues for the PaaS deployment.
- Contoso will use [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cost-management) to ensure they stay within budgets established by their IT leadership.
