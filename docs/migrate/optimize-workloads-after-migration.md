# Optimize workloads after migration

A successful migration doesn't end at cutover. Post-migration optimization ensures workloads operate efficiently, securely, and cost-effectively in Azure. This phase overlaps with ongoing operations and sets the foundation for long-term cloud maturity.

## Fine-tune workload configurations

A workload’s behavior often changes after migration due to differences in infrastructure, scaling, and service architecture. Immediate configuration adjustments help stabilize performance and reduce unnecessary costs.

1. **Use Azure Advisor to identify optimization opportunities.** [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) provides tailored recommendations across cost, performance, reliability, and security. These insights help you prioritize actions based on value and feasibility. Access Azure Advisor from the Azure portal and review recommendations by category.

2. **Apply service-specific configuration guidance.** Each Azure service has unique tuning parameters. Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework [Azure services guides](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/?product=popular) to align configurations with best practices. This guidance helps ensure workloads are optimized for Azure.

3. **Review Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations.** [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations) identifies security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Address these issues early to reduce risk exposure and align with your organization’s security posture.

## Validate critical configurations

A successful post-migration period depends on verifying that workloads operate as expected in the new environment. This validation ensures that performance, availability, and cost align with business and technical objectives. You should validate and adjust monitoring, cost, and backup configurations to detect issues early and maintain operational continuity.

### Validate workload monitoring

1. **Confirm that metric and log data is complete and current.** Review telemetry from all critical components to ensure that metrics and logs are flowing as expected. This step is important to detect gaps caused by changes in resource IDs, namespaces, or agent configurations. Use Azure Monitor or your preferred monitoring solution to compare current telemetry against premigration baselines.

1. **Validate that alerts trigger under expected conditions.** Review alert rules to confirm they reflect current thresholds and conditions. This validation is important because workload behavior might shift post-migration, requiring updated thresholds or scopes. Adjust alert logic to reduce noise and ensure timely response to real issues.

1. **Review dashboards for relevance and accuracy.** Ensure that dashboards reflect the current architecture and operational priorities. This step is important to support effective decision-making and trend analysis. Update visualizations to include new resources, remove deprecated ones, and align with current SLOs.

## Validate cost monitoring

1. **Compare current costs to pre-migration baselines.** Use Microsoft Cost Management or partner tools to identify cost increases. This step is important to detect changes caused by autoscaling, feature enablement, or inefficient configurations. Investigate discrepancies by reviewing resource-level cost breakdowns.

1. **Identify and adjust cost drivers.** Review workloads that show significant cost changes. This validation is important to detect issues such as over-provisioned resources, inefficient queries, or misconfigured scaling policies. Use Azure Advisor to identify optimization opportunities and adjust configurations accordingly.

For more information, see [Monitor costs](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#monitor-costs).

### Validate backups

1. **Update governance policies and maintain audit trails.** Revise data governance policies to reflect new Azure storage locations, retention schedules, and compliance obligations. Implement [lifecycle management policies](/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview) for automated tier transitions and retention enforcement. Configure comprehensive audit logging for all data access and management activities. Establish regular compliance reviews and reporting processes to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements. Document policy changes and maintain audit-ready records of all data governance decisions and implementations.

1. **Verify that backup jobs complete successfully.** Review backup job logs to confirm that all required workloads are included and that jobs complete without errors. This step is important to detect scope gaps or misconfigurations introduced during migration. Use Azure Backup or service-native backup features to validate job status.

1. **Test restore procedures to confirm recovery objectives.** Perform structured restore tests to validate that data is recoverable within defined RTOs and RPOs. This validation is important to ensure readiness for real-world recovery scenarios. Document test results and adjust backup policies or procedures as needed.

For more information, see [Manage data reliability](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/protect#manage-data-reliability).

## Collect and act on user feedback

User feedback provides real-world validation of workload performance and usability. This validation helps identify gaps that automated monitoring might miss. You should collect, prioritize, and act on feedback to continuously improve workload quality and user satisfaction.

1. **Gather structured feedback from end users.** Use surveys, interviews, or support tickets to collect feedback on performance, reliability, and usability. Use tools like Microsoft Forms or other platforms to streamline collection.

2. **Document and prioritize issues.**  Centralize all feedback in a backlog using Azure DevOps or GitHub Issues. Categorize issues by severity and business value. Prioritize high-severity issues that affect business continuity, user experience, or compliance. This approach ensures transparency and alignment across teams.

3. **Assign ownership for follow-up actions.** Assign each issue or improvement opportunity to a specific individual or team. Ownership ensures accountability and timely resolution. Use tagging, assignment, and notification features in your backlog management tool to track progress and maintain visibility.

4. **Resolve and communicate improvements.** Address high-priority issues promptly and communicate outcomes to stakeholders. Highlight measurable improvements such as reduced latency, increased uptime, or improved usability. It reinforces the value of cloud adoption and builds trust with users.

## Schedule regular workload reviews

Regular reviews help identify optimization opportunities across cost, performance, reliability, security, and operational excellence. You should integrate these reviews into your cloud governance rhythm to maintain consistency and maturity.

1. **Conduct quarterly reviews.** A quarterly cadence ensures timely identification of optimization opportunities across cost, performance, reliability, security, and operational excellence. This frequency balances agility with governance. Use the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) to assess workloads and document improvement areas. Integrate these reviews into your cloud governance rhythm to maintain consistency.

## Optimize hybrid and multicloud dependencies

Hybrid and multicloud architectures introduce complexity that requires monitoring.

1. **Monitor cross-cloud and on-premises dependencies.** Use Azure Arc to extend Azure management to non-Azure resources and Azure Network Watcher to monitor connectivity. Track latency, availability, and service health across environments.

1. **Secure and monitor hybrid connections.** Use Azure VPN Gateway, Azure ExpressRoute, or Azure Bastion for secure connectivity. Enable diagnostics and alerts to detect anomalies such as packet loss or unauthorized access attempts.

1. **Plan to reduce external dependencies.** Identify opportunities to replace components with Azure-native services to simplify architecture and reduce risk.

## Share migration outcomes

A clear summary of migration outcomes validates the success of cloud adoption and builds support for future initiatives. You should track and communicate measurable improvements such as cost savings, performance gains, and operational resilience. Use data from Azure Monitor, Cost Management, and incident tracking tools to quantify outcomes. Share concise, business-relevant examples with stakeholders.
