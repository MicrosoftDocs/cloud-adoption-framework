# Optimize workloads after migration

A successful migration does not end at cutover. Post-migration optimization ensures workloads operate efficiently, securely, and cost-effectively in Azure. This phase overlaps with ongoing operations and sets the foundation for long-term cloud maturity.

## Fine-tune workload configurations

A workload’s behavior often changes after migration due to differences in infrastructure, scaling, and service architecture. Immediate configuration adjustments help stabilize performance and reduce unnecessary costs.

1. **Use Azure Advisor to identify optimization opportunities.** [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) provides tailored recommendations across cost, performance, reliability, and security. These insights help you prioritize actions based on impact and feasibility. Access Azure Advisor from the Azure portal and review recommendations by category.

2. **Apply service-specific configuration guidance.** Each Azure service has unique tuning parameters. Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework [Azure services guides](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/?product=popular) to align configurations with best practices. This ensures workloads are optimized for Azure-native capabilities.

3. **Review Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations.** [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations) identifies security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Address these issues early to reduce risk exposure and align with your organization’s security posture.

## Configure monitoring and alerting

Cost visibility and control become essential immediately after migration. Azure's elasticity benefits organizations but requires active monitoring to prevent cost inefficiencies from scaling automatically.

1. **Validate monitoring.** The first few days or weeks post-migration serve as a “bake-in” period. Ensure that performance, availability, and usage patterns align with expectations. Confirm that Azure Monitor is capturing the right metrics and alerts are configured appropriately. [Configure monitoring](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#configure-monitoring) to collect insights that enable proactive issue detection. [Configure alerts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#configure-alerting) for timely issue response, and create dashboards to [Visualize monitoring data](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#visualize-monitoring-data).

1. **Monitor costs** Cost anomalies typically stem from either workload changes (enabling new features) or unexpected behavior in Azure. For example, autoscaling or inefficient SQL queries that were throttled on-premises might now consume more resources. Use Azure Cost Management or partner tools to spot cost anomalies and Azure Advisor for relevant performance and reliability improvements. Compare current costs to your premigration baseline. Identify and address any configuration or feature changes that are driving up costs. For more information, see [Monitor costs](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#monitor-costs).

### Verify backup jobs are configured and running successfully

1. **Configure backup jobs.** A successful backup job ensures that data is consistently captured and stored according to policy. Identify workloads that require backups and ensure they are included in your backup scope. Use backup features built-in to some Azure services. Otherwise, use [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview), or third-party tools that support Azure workloads.

1. **Monitor backup job status.** Ensure backup jobs are configured correctly and completing successfully. Test restore procedures to confirm data recoverability. Review backup scope to ensure all databases, file systems, and application data are included. Use Use [Azure Backup Reports](/azure/backup/configure-reports) in Azure Monitor or Recovery Services Vault dashboards to track job success rates, failure patterns, and backup trends across your environment. Set up automated alerts for failed or missed backup jobs to enable immediate response to issues. Investigate and resolve failures immediately. Review error codes and logs to determine root causes. Common issues include network interruptions, storage limits, or misconfigured policies.

1. **Test restore procedures to validate recovery objectives.** Restore testing validates that backup data is recoverable and usable within your defined recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). Regular testing identifies issues before they affect production recovery scenarios. You should perform structured restore tests that simulate real-world failure conditions and document results for continuous improvement.

1. **Review backup policies for compliance alignment.** Backup policy validation ensures that data protection strategies meet organizational governance requirements and regulatory obligations. Regular policy reviews prevent compliance gaps and align backup practices with evolving business needs. You should establish systematic policy review processes that cover retention, encryption, and frequency requirements.

For data reliability, see [Manage data reliability](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/protect#manage-data-reliability).

## Collect and act on user feedback

User feedback provides real-world validation of workload performance and usability.

1. **Gather structured feedback from end users.** Use surveys, interviews, or support tickets to collect feedback on performance, reliability, and usability.

2. **Document and prioritize issues.** Track feedback in a centralized system and categorize by severity and impact. Address high-priority issues promptly.

3. **Share positive outcomes.** Highlight improvements such as faster response times or increased availability to reinforce migration success.

## Prepare operations teams for Azure

Operational readiness reduces downtime and accelerates incident response.

1. **Provide targeted training and documentation.** Create quick-reference guides for common tasks such as restarting services, accessing logs, or scaling resources.

2. **Ensure access to monitoring, backup, and security tools.** Confirm that operations teams have the necessary permissions and tools to manage workloads effectively.

3. **Establish escalation paths and support contacts.** Document who to contact for different types of issues and ensure this information is easily accessible.

For more information, see [Ready your Azure cloud operations ](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/ready#document-your-cloud-operations).

## Monitor hybrid and multi-cloud dependencies

Hybrid and multi-cloud architectures introduce complexity that requires additional monitoring.

1. **Monitor cross-cloud and on-premises dependencies.** Use tools like Azure Arc and Network Watcher to track latency, availability, and connectivity between environments.

2. **Secure hybrid connections.** Ensure VPNs, ExpressRoute, or other connectivity solutions are configured securely and monitored for anomalies.

3. **Plan to reduce external dependencies.** Identify opportunities to replace third-party or on-premises components with Azure-native services to simplify architecture and reduce risk.

## Schedule regular architecture reviews

Architecture reviews help identify modernization opportunities and prevent technical debt.

1. **Conduct quarterly reviews.** Use the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/). Evaluate workloads across cost, performance, reliability, security, and operational excellence.

2. **Create a backlog of modernization opportunities.** Document findings and prioritize based on business value, risk reduction, and technical debt.

3. **Assign ownership for follow-up actions.** Designate responsibility structure and includes embedded links to relevant Azure tos and documentation.
