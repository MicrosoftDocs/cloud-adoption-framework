|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud Strategy and Planning | - Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) planning<br>- Migration wave planning<br>- Stakeholder communication<br>- Risk and rollback planning<br>- RACI modeling | Aligns migration with business goals, ensures accountability, and reduces risk through structured planning and communication. |
| Dependency Mapping & Architecture | - Dependency mapping<br>- Azure architecture design<br>- Hybrid/cloud integration planning<br>- Network and DNS planning | Prevents broken integrations and performance issues by grouping interdependent systems and designing resilient architectures. |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | - Bicep or Terraform<br>- GitHub or Azure DevOps<br>- CI/CD pipeline creation | Enables repeatable, consistent deployments and accelerates migration through automation and version control. |
| Workload Assessment & Readiness | - Azure Migrate<br>- OS and driver compatibility checks<br>- Refactoring for Azure services<br>- Identity and access management | Identifies and resolves compatibility issues early, reducing cutover risk and ensuring workloads are Azure-ready. |
| Migration Execution       | - Offline and online migration strategies<br>- Azure Database Migration Service<br>- Data transfer tools<br>- DNS and traffic redirection | Ensures smooth and timely migration with minimal disruption, using the right strategy and tools for each workload. |
| Testing and Validation    | - Azure resource provisioning<br>- Functional and performance testing<br>- Data integrity validation<br>- Failover testing | Confirms workloads function correctly in Azure before production cutover, reducing the risk of post-migration issues. |
| Post-Migration Optimization | - Azure Monitor and Advisor<br>- Azure Cost Management<br>- Backup validation<br>- User feedback collection<br>- Support team readiness | Ensures workloads are stable, secure, and cost-effective after migration, and that support teams are prepared to manage the new environment. |
