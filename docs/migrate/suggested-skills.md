# Skills readiness for cloud migration

During a cloud migration, it is likely that employees, as well as some incumbent systems integration partners or managed services partners, will need to develop new skills to be effective during migration efforts.

There are four distinct processes that are completed iteratively in the Migrate methodology. The following sections align the necessary skills for each of those processes with references to two prerequisites for skilling resources.

## Prerequisites skilling resources

Implementation of the Migrate methodology builds on the skills acquired during the [Plan phase](../strategy/suggested-skills.md) and [Ready phase](../organize/suggested-skills.md) of the migration journey.

## Assess skilling resources

The following tools can aid the team in execution of assess activities:

- [Balance the portfolio](../strategy/balance-the-portfolio.md): Ensure balance and proper investment allocations across an application portfolio.
- [Build a business justification](../strategy/cloud-migration-business-case.md): Create and understand the business justification driving the cloud migration effort.
- [Rationalize the digital estate](../digital-estate/rationalize.md): Rationalize assets in the digital estate.
- [Application portfolio assessment](/learn/modules/app-and-infra-migration-and-modernization): Criteria for making decisions regarding migration or innovation options within the application portfolio.
- [Assessing and planning Microsoft Azure migration](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-migration-assessing-planning): A Pluralsight course to aid in assessing on-premises workloads.

During assess processes, architects will design solutions for each workload. The following skilling resources help prepare architects for these tasks:

- [Foundations for cloud architecture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): A Pluralsight course to help architect the right foundational solutions.
- [Microsoft Azure architecture: Getting started](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/azure-architecture-getting-started): A Pluralsight course to give architects a foundational knowledge in Azure architecture.
- [Designing migrations for Microsoft Azure](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-migrations-designing): A Pluralsight course to help architects design a migration solution.

## Migrate skilling resources

The following tutorial can prepare the team for migration activities:

- [Migrate to Azure](/azure/site-recovery/migrate-tutorial-on-premises-azure): Using Azure Migrate to migrate VMs to Azure.
- [Rehosting workloads to Azure](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-workloads-rehosting): A Pluralsight course that teaches viewers how to rehost workloads to Azure.
- [Migrating physical and virtual servers to Azure](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-migrating-physical-virtual-servers): A Pluralsight course for migrating servers to Azure.
- [Import and export data to Azure](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-import-export-data): A Pluralsight course on the movement of data to and from Azure.

## Optimize and promote process changes

The following tools can help the team optimize resources and promote to production:

- [Cost and sizing](./azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-costs.md): Adjust sizing to align costs and budgets.
- [Promote a workload](./azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-networking.md): Change network configuration to reroute production users to migrated workloads.

## Secure and manage process changes

The following tools can help the team find ways to secure and manage migrated assets:

- [Secure and manage workloads in Azure](./azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-security-management.md): Best practices for securing and managing workloads in Azure.
