# Migration deployment checklist

In the deploy phase of your adoption journey, you begin the technical implementation of the migration. You can use the workload architecture and assessment materials from the assess phase to begin deployment and remediation of problems. You can also begin to replicate servers to Azure, prepare them for migration, and run your technical tests.

This phase can be the most technically demanding. It's important to make sure you complete your remediation activities and do detailed testing. You should have a clear understanding of how your services operate together. By the end of this phase, you should have high confidence that your workload is ready to operate in Azure and that you're ready to plan for the workload release.
