# Migration release checklist

This phase guides you through releasing your deployed workloads to production use. It includes the technical processes of taking your final migration steps, communicating to the business, making final change approvals, cleaning up resources, and learning from the migration.

## Conduct the migration

When you reach this phase, you have your resources deployed into Azure, either as new resources with replicated data in a properly configured state or as a replicated server through a migration tool. From a technical perspective, all that remains to do is to start the final migration tasks and send traffic over to the new location.

However, you need to do more to make sure the migration is successful. Clear communication with the business and support teams is critical, as is finalizing activities, including a proper retrospective, after the migration.

Failure to communicate, test, or successfully migrate resources can create outages and business disruptions. A failure to decommission retired assets or optimize workloads can lead to a failure to achieve the business outcomes of the migration. To avoid these problems, you need to finish the migration strong.
