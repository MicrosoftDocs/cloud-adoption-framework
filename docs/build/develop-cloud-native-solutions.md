## Develop cloud-native solution

After careful planning, the next step in cloud modernization is developing the cloud-native app or feature

## Develop new cloud-native solutions in a nonproduction environment

1. Follow Well-Architected Framework principles. Apply reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency guidance as you design and build cloud-native solutions changes.

1. Create nonproduction environments that mirror production configuration (if adding new features). Create Azure resources that match production topology using similar service types and configurations. Use Azure DevTest Labs to create consistent environments with cost controls and automated provisioning.

1. Implement changes incrementally using source control practices. Use Git repositories to manage code changes and enable continuous integration workflows. Break cloud-native development work into small, testable increments that can be merged and validated frequently.

### Validate cloud-native solutions with testing

1. Conduct end-to-end functional testing to verify business processes. Test all critical user workflows from sign-in to transaction completion using realistic scenarios. Execute regression tests to confirm unchanged functionality remains intact after modernization. Validate new features and updated interfaces meet business requirements without breaking existing processes.

1. Perform user acceptance testing with business stakeholders. Engage business users to execute key workflows in the test environment and compare results with legacy system behavior. Capture feedback on usability, performance, and functionality gaps. Resolve critical user acceptance testing (UAT) issues before deployment and obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders to confirm business readiness.

1. Validate performance using load testing under realistic conditions. Use Azure Load Testing to simulate expected production traffic patterns and measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Compare results against performance baselines from the source environment to identify any degradation. Conduct stress tests at 150% of expected load to determine system limits and validate resilience under pressure.

1. Execute security validation and compliance checks. Run vulnerability scans on new code and container images to detect security risks. Perform compliance validation for regulated workloads using industry-specific tools. Use Azure Defender for Cloud to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations and validate security controls meet requirements.

1. Resolve all critical issues before production deployment. Fix functional, performance, and security issues identified during testing phases. Confirm all tests pass and performance meets SLA requirements. Document any remaining low-priority issues and create remediation plans for post-deployment resolution.

1. Execute unit and integration tests on all modified components (if adding new feature). Run automated unit tests on refactored code modules to verify isolated functionality works as expected. Execute integration tests across dependent services to confirm APIs, databases, and external systems communicate correctly. Rerun tests after each bug fix to prevent regressions and maintain system stability.
