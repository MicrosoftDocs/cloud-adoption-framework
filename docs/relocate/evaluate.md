# Evaluate a cloud workload for relocation

Evaluate is the first step in the Move phase of relocation. The goal of the Evaluate step is to understand the workload you want to relocate so you can move it successfully. Every workload you relocate must go through the four steps of the Move phase, starting with the Evaluate step.

In the relocation process, there are two phases and five steps. The first phase is the Initiate phase, and it has one step called Initiate. The second phase is the Move phase, and it has four steps that you repeat for each workload. The steps are Evaluate, Select, Migrate, and Cutover." lightbox="../_images/relocate/caf-relocate-evaluate.png" border="false":::

## Pick workload(s)

You should have a prioritized list of workloads, and the list should identify the order you want to relocate your workloads. Each time you visit the evaluate step, pick the workload(s) at the top of the list. For smaller teams, you should relocate one workload at a time. It's a chance to learn and improve with each workload relocation. Larger teams should consider relocating multiple workloads. Bulk relocations can help achieve economies of scale.

## Conduct discovery

Workload discovery is the foundation of relocation. The primary goal is to identify all dependencies and endpoints. Dependencies are resources or services that the workload needs to run. Dependencies include Azure services, third-party apps, licenses, partner teams. You need to consider networking, firewalls, cost, testing, tagging, identities, product features, zonal support, and policies. You should also identify all the endpoints or IP addresses associated with the workload. It's worth noting that public IP addresses are region specific. You can't move them between regions. You need to export the configuration of a public IP and deploy it to the new target region. For more information, see [Move Azure Public IP configuration to another Azure region](/azure/virtual-network/move-across-regions-publicip-powershell).

Where possible, use automated tools to collect information about applications and Azure services that make up your workload. You can use these tools to perform low-level discovery and architecture design discovery for the relocation of a specific workload. You should use the following Azure tools and services.

**Try Azure Resource Mover first.** You should try to use Azure Resource Mover first. It's the easiest discovery tool to use, and you can also relocate services and data. Azure Resource Mover only supports a limited number of services, so make sure your services are supported before continuing. For more information, see [Supported resources for Azure Resource Mover](/azure/resource-mover/overview#what-resources-can-i-move-across-regions).

**Use visualization tools.** If Azure Resource Mover doesn't meet all your needs, you can use visualization tools to aid your discovery. Azure has several visualization tools that you can use to map dependencies. Pick the tool that best supports your needs.

- *Resource group visualizer:* You can you visualize the connections between the resources in a resource group. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group and select *Resource visualizer* from the left navigation.

- *Azure Monitor topology:* You can view network dependencies with the topology feature in Azure Monitor. For more information, see [Network insights topology](/azure/network-watcher/network-insights-topology).

- *Application Insights:* Application Insights has an application mapping feature where you can view the logical structure of a distributed application. For more information, see [Application map in Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-map?tabs=net).

- *Azure Resource Explorer:* Azure Resource Explorer lists every resource in your Microsoft Entra tenant. It gives you visibility but doesn't indicate dependencies. You must map workload components and dependencies manually. For more information, see [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/).

- *Azure Resource Graph:* Azure Resource Graph allows you to run queries against the resources in a Microsoft Entra tenant. Resource Graph is accessible in the portal and from the command line. You must map workload components and dependencies manually. For more information, see [Azure Resource Graph documentation](/azure/governance/resource-graph/shared-query-azure-cli).

**Manually create documentation if needed.** If automated discovery approaches aren't enough, you can conduct a manual assessment of the workloads. Most manual assessments rely on interviews with technical experts and technical documentation to get the information needed. Identify product or application owners and interview them. These interviews are optional, but necessary when the team needs to cover gaps in the information the tools provide.

## Find region supportability

Not every region in Azure offers the same services, so you must make sure the services your workload needs to run are available in the target region. It might seem late in the process to make this determination, but you need the discovery details to ensure supportability. To determine region supportability for your workload, see the [products and services available in each Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region).

Know if the target region is a paired region or not and if it supports availability zones. Region pairing and availability zones don't affect the relocation effort, but they do affect your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy in the target region. For more information, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) and [Availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support#azure-regions-with-availability-zone-support).

## Categorize workload services

Relocation happens at the service and component level. Most workloads use multiple services. There are two primary types of services, stateful and stateless. You need to categorize each service as stateful or stateless. This knowledge helps you determine dependencies, understand service integrations, and narrows your relocation automation options.

**Stateless services:** Stateless services have configuration information only. These services don't need continuous replication of data to move. Examples include virtual networks, network adapters, load balancers, and network security groups.

**Stateful services:** Stateful services have configuration information and data that need to move. Examples include virtual machines and SQL databases.

## Next steps

Evaluating your workload provides enough information to select a relocation method and the tools to execute the method you choose. The Select step walks you through the decisions to pick a relocation method and the correct tools for the relocation method.
