# People strategy for AI agents

Adopting AI agents is not merely a technical initiative. It’s a strategic transformation that touches every part of the organization. Success depends not only on the right tools and platforms, but also on the right people, structures, and skills. As a technical leader, your role is to architect a team model that balances centralized governance with decentralized innovation, ensuring that every team from engineering to business operations can contribute effectively to AI adoption.

## Roles and responsibilities for agents

Start by establishing a **clear ownership model** for AI across the organization. Define who sets the AI strategy, who builds and maintains agents, and how teams collaborate. You should formalize this through a **platform-and-workload team structure.**

### Platform team responsibilities

The platform team should be centrally managed typically within IT or engineering and responsible for delivering repeatable AI agent capabilities that workload teams need. The platform should also enforce governance policies across workload environments and have visibility into all agents performance and logs.

### Workload team responsibilities

Workload teams, embedded within business units, should be empowered to innovate using these platform services. Your role is to ensure they have the autonomy to define agent requirements, build conversational flows, prepare domain-specific data, and integrate agents into local systems while staying within the guardrails provided by the platform team.

### Create enabling teams

To accelerate adoption and reduce friction, you should establish an AI Center of Excellence (CoE). This is not a governance body. It’s an enabling function. Staff it with specialists who can provide reusable templates, training programs, and short-term project support. The CoE should host internal workshops, investigate emerging technologies, and share best practices across teams. As a leader, you must ensure the CoE has the authority and resources to act as a multiplier across the organization.

## Agent skill assessment and training

AI competency directly impacts business outcomes such as return on investment, risk mitigation, and operational efficiency. Treating AI skills as a strategic asset ensures your organization uses AI responsibly and effectively.

### Assess current skills

Begin by conducting a **skills assessment** across your organization. Identify the roles critical to AI success. Common roles include:

- Data scientists and ML engineers to fine-tune models and analyze outputs.
- Software engineers for integration and tool development.
- UX designers for conversational experience design.
- AI product managers for roadmap and delivery oversight.
- Security and compliance experts for governance.

Evaluate whether your teams have experience with large language models, AI-driven analytics, and conversational UX. Document gaps such as developers skilled in web applications but unfamiliar with AI integration. This assessment informs whether to train existing staff or hire new talent

### Close agent skill gap

Once gaps are identified, **launch structured training programs**. Use Microsoft Learn to upskill teams on Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Encourage certification through Azure AI learning paths. Organize internal workshops on topics like prompt engineering and agent design, and supplement with external consultants where needed. You should sponsor hackathons and pilot projects to give teams hands-on experience and build confidence.

#### Start and build new skills in parallel

In parallel, adopt a **phased skill-building strategy**. Start with platforms your teams already understand, such as Copilot Studio, and begin deploying agents. Simultaneously, send a subset of your staff for training on Azure AI Foundry to prepare for more advanced custom agents. Consider bringing in Microsoft partners to launch initial projects while your team shadows and learns.

#### Continuous training

Importantly, extend training beyond developers. Ensure that **domain experts** within workload teams understand how to work with AI agents, how to feed them new information, interpret outputs, and recognize limitations. Train support and operations teams to maintain and troubleshoot AI solutions. You should mandate cross-functional training and allocate budget for ongoing learning, recognizing that AI technologies evolve rapidly.
