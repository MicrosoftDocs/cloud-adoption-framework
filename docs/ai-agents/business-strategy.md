# Business strategy for AI agents

Successful adoption of AI agents begins with a clear strategy that connects agent capabilities to business objectives. Organizations must plan early across technology, workforce, and data readiness. This preparation enables leaders to define where AI agents create the most value and how to structure teams for success. AI agents help enrich employee experiences, transform customer interactions, streamline operations, and accelerate innovation cycles.

## When to use AI agents?

Use AI agents for challenges that require complex reasoning, dynamic interaction, or unstructured data especially when natural language provides the most effective interface. These scenarios often support digital transformation goals such as increasing agility, reducing manual effort, and scaling personalization. Common examples include customer support automation, knowledge retrieval, process automation, and real-time insights generation

1. **When not to use AI agents.** Do not use AI agents for problems that simpler tools or scripts already solve. Prioritize low-risk, low-effort solutions first. Misuse increases cost and complexity without added value. Run a pilot to validate feasibility and impact before scaling.

2. **Identify viable use cases.** Direct teams to explore proven patterns and validated examples from other organizations. Use resources like the [Microsoft Scenario Library](https://adoption.microsoft.com/scenario-library/) and [AI Use Cases catalog](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/use-case) pto guide planning. These references help avoid common design flaws and accelerate solution development. Include them in workshops and use them to benchmark internal ideas.

## How to prioritize AI agent use cases

Early wins with measurable outcomes build momentum and secure executive support for broader AI investments. Not all agent initiatives deliver equal value. Prioritize use cases that align with strategic goals and demonstrate impact quickly. Focus on projects that offer high business value and low implementation complexity. Use three criteria to evaluate and rank candidate use cases: business impact (value), technical feasibility (complexity), and user desirability (value).

### Evaluate business impact

Assess each use case based on its potential to improve key performance indicators (KPIs) and deliver return on investment. Select projects that reduce operational costs, increase customer satisfaction, or improve service delivery. Require a concise business case for each candidate, including specific metrics such as "reduce support ticket handling time by 20% within 3 months."

### Measure technical feasibility

Determine whether the organization can implement the use case with current systems, data, and skills. Identify risks such as poor data quality, system dependencies, or integration challenges. Define the scope, autonomy level, and decision boundaries for each agent. Use a change management matrix to assess rollout timelines and user impact. Prioritize use cases with short deployment cycles and minimal disruption. Favor scenarios that integrate with existing systems through documented APIs or connectors.

### Measure user desirability

Confirm that users or customers recognize the problem and accept an AI-driven solution. Collect evidence through interviews or surveys that show clear pain points and openness to change. Prioritize projects with strong user advocates and minimal resistance. An AI agent only succeeds when people use it consistently and trust its output.

## Define success metrics

Establish measurable success criteria for each AI agent use case before development begins. These criteria must link directly to business outcomes such as reduced processing time, improved customer satisfaction scores, or increased operational efficiency. Success metrics define the expected return on investment and set the timeline for evaluation.

1. **Set baseline business goals.** Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that the agent must improve. For existing processes, measure current performance to establish a baseline. This comparison enables accurate tracking of post-deployment impact. For new processes or early-stage businesses, estimate initial performance targets and refine them as operations mature.

1. **Use business metrics as decision gates.** Apply success criteria throughout the development lifecycle to guide investment decisions. Use these metrics as checkpoints to determine whether the project continues, pivots, or stops. If a pilot fails to meet predefined benchmarks, reassess the use case or terminate the initiative to avoid unnecessary cost and effort.

1. **Evaluate post-deployment performance.** Continue measuring success after integration. Compare actual results against target KPIs to determine whether the agent delivers expected value. If the agent underperforms, use the data to decide whether to refine the solution, retire it, or redirect resources to more promising opportunities.

This structured approach ensures that every AI agent initiative remains accountable to business value and supports continuous improvement across the portfolio.
