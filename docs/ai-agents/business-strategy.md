# Business strategy for AI agents

**Should you invest in agents? If so, why and where?** The first phase is to design a clear AI agent strategy that ties directly to business goals and establishes a foundation for success. A well-defined strategy ensures you invest in AI agents where they provide real value and sets guardrails to manage risk from the start. As a technical leader, you should prioritize ROI and risk management in this phase, guiding both platform and workload teams on where to focus. By the end of this phase, you will have a roadmap of high-impact use cases with success metrics and an implementation approach that maximizes value for effort.

## When to use AI agents

**Identify AI agent use cases that directly support key business objectives and avoid those with low impact.** All AI agents initiatives must begin with a clear business rationale: *Why should we invest in AI agents and where will we see the most ROI?* Focus on scenarios that promise significant improvements in core business KPIs like efficiency, revenue, or customer satisfaction. Engage business stakeholders early to ensure the proposed agent will solve a real problem that executives care about. For example, an agent that automates customer support could align with a goal to improve service while reducing costs.

1. **Avoid agents for easily scripted tasks.** If a problem can be solved with a simple script, automation tool, or existing software, use those solutions instead. AI agents are best reserved for challenges that involve reasoning over complex data or dynamic interaction, especially when inputs and outputs vary widely and natural language is the most effective interface. This helps reduce wasted effort and unnecessary risk.

2. **Target frequent interactions.** Look for use cases that are frequent, time-consuming, and follow recognizable patterns or business rules, but where the variability of inputs and outputs makes traditional automation impractical. These tasks often require interpretation, judgment, or flexible communication. Examples include triaging IT support tickets, summarizing customer feedback, or extracting key details from unstructured documents. If the task is routine and well-understood, and natural language is the best way to describe or perform it, it’s a strong candidate for agent-based automation.

3. **Confirm genuine user need and openness to AI.** Before building an agent, validate that users need help in the target area and are open to using an AI solution. This may involve surveys, interviews, or pilot tests. Agents only deliver value if they are adopted. For example, employees may welcome an AI assistant for tedious data entry, while customers might resist an AI in a sensitive advisory role. Use demos or early prototypes to test user acceptance and refine the experience.

## Where to invest in AI Agents

Not all potential projects are equal. Focus on the “low-hanging fruit” that can demonstrate value quickly, as well as those aligned to major strategic goals. Early wins build momentum, and strategic projects secure executive buy-in.

1. **Align projects to KPIs and strategic initiatives.** Choose use cases that clearly support top business objectives. If the company’s strategy is to reduce operating costs by 10%, an agent that automates an expensive process is a good candidate. Tie each agent to a measurable business metric (“reduce average support call time by 20%”). This tethering ensures that when the project succeeds, the business sees concrete value in terms they understand.

2. **Start with low-complexity, high-impact scenarios.** Direct your teams to start with problems that are relatively easy to solve but yield significant results. Evaluate each idea for data availability, technical complexity, and regulatory constraints. Favor those with fewer unknowns. For example, an internal FAQ bot using existing documentation is a low-complexity project that can show immediate productivity gains. Quick wins prove the concept and justify further investment.

3. **Consider technical and integration feasibility.** Prioritize use cases where the agent can easily integrate with existing systems via well-documented APIs or connectors. Robust integration points reduce development effort and error. In contrast, if a required system has no API, that use case might be lower priority unless you have a plan to expose it. Steer your teams toward projects with available, accessible data sources and interfaces.

4. **Define the agent’s scope and autonomy upfront.** For each use case, teams should delineate what the agent will do and what it will not do. Decide together how much autonomy it should have: Will it only provide recommendations, or also take actions? What decisions must always fall to humans? Setting these boundaries early guides the design and manages risk. It also sets expectations with stakeholders about the agent’s role.

5. **Learn from other businesses.** Encourage your strategy team to review external resources for inspiration and validation. The [Microsoft Scenario Library](https://adoption.microsoft.com/scenario-library/) and [AI Use Cases catalog](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/use-case) can help validate your ideas, reveal new possibilities, and ensure your chosen task aligns with proven patterns.

## How to measure success

Before development begins, establish how you will measure success in business terms. Define key outcomes like time saved, error reduction, customer satisfaction scores, conversion rates, or cost savings that the agent is expected to influence.

1. **Set target values and timelines.** Define what success looks like numerically (“reduce handling time by 20% within 3 months of launch”). This gives your team a clear goal and provides a checkpoint to evaluate the agent after deployment. Ensure the timeline to see these results aligns with business expectations for ROI.

2. **Establish a baseline.** Measure current performance of the process before the agent is introduced (“current average handle time is 10 minutes, error rate 5%”). A baseline allows you to definitively quantify the agent’s impact post-deployment. Without it, you risk debates later about whether the AI made a difference.

3. **Use success criteria as go/no-go gates.** Use these metrics during the project. If early prototypes or pilot results are far off from targets, reassess the project’s viability. It’s better to pivot or cancel a weak initiative early than to deploy and maintain an agent that doesn’t justify its cost.
