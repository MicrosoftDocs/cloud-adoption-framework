# Business strategy for AI agents

AI agents create measurable value when aligned with strategic business priorities. These agents can reshape internal operations and transform customer engagement, but their success depends on careful planning, prioritization, and performance measurement. This guidance helps technical decision makers identify high-value opportunities, evaluate feasibility, and define success metrics that ensure AI agent investments deliver business impact across the cloud estate. **Prerequisite**: [Understand AI agents](./index.md#what-is-an-ai-agent)

Each quadrant contains specific examples of how AI agents can create business value." lightbox="./images/ai-agent-opportunities.png" border="false":::

The following four areas highlight where AI agents can have the greatest impact across an organization and explain why adopting agents should be considered as part of a broader business strategy.

- **Reshape business processes (internal impact)**: AI agents can accelerate software development cycles, improve candidate screening and lead qualification, and resolve customer issues more effectively.

- **Enrich employee experiences (internal impact)**: AI agents can make data easier to find, simplify email composition, and transcribe calls accurately. These agent capabilities increase productivity by allowing employees to focus on higher-value work. AI agents also streamline communication and task handoffs across teams, which improves collaboration and overall throughput. These agent outcomes reduce cycle times and increase employee satisfaction.

- **Reinvent customer engagement (external impact)**: AI agents can reduce support resolution times and improve responsiveness, which leads to higher customer satisfaction. These agents also ensure consistent execution and maintain data quality across customer-facing processes.

- **Accelerate innovation (external impact)**: AI agents can shorten product development cycles and enable proactive service recommendations. These agent capabilities support faster experimentation and iteration across product and service lines, which helps organizations respond more effectively to changing market demands.

## Where to use AI agents

Most successful agents support and integrate into larger business processes. Organizations achieve the best results when they deploy AI agents for challenges that require complex reasoning, dynamic interaction, or unstructured data, especially when natural language provides the most effective interface. These agent scenarios often support digital transformation goals such as increased agility, reduced manual effort, and scaled personalization. Common examples include customer support automation, knowledge retrieval, process automation, and real-time insights generation.

1. **When not to use AI agents.** Don't use AI agents for problems that simpler tools or scripts already solve effectively. For example, static forms, rule-based automation, or straightforward data queries often require less overhead and governance. AI agents increase cost and complexity without delivering more value in these scenarios.

    Before you scale any agent-based solution, validate its feasibility and impact through a pilot program. AI agents introduce nondeterministic behavior, which requires careful governance, monitoring, and fallback mechanisms. Assess risk, effort, and expected return before each deployment.

2. **Identify viable use cases.** Direct teams to explore proven patterns and validated examples from other organizations. Use resources such as the [Microsoft Scenario Library](https://adoption.microsoft.com/scenario-library/) and [AI Use Cases catalog](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/use-case) to guide planning. These reference resources help avoid common design flaws and accelerate solution development. Include these resources in workshops and use them to benchmark internal ideas.

## How to prioritize AI agent adoption

Organizations build momentum and secure executive support for broader AI investments when they achieve early wins with measurable outcomes. Not all agent initiatives deliver equal value. Prioritize use cases that align with strategic goals and demonstrate impact quickly. Focus on projects that offer high business value and low implementation complexity. Use three criteria to evaluate and rank candidate use cases: business impact, technical feasibility, and user desirability.

### Evaluate business impact

Assess each use case based on its potential to improve key performance indicators (KPIs) and deliver return on investment. Select projects that reduce operational costs, increase customer satisfaction, or improve service delivery. Require a concise business case for each candidate use case, including specific metrics such as "reduce support ticket handling time by 20% within three months."

### Measure technical feasibility

Determine whether the organization can implement the use case with current systems, data, and skills. Identify risks such as poor data quality, system dependencies, or integration challenges. Define the scope, autonomy level, and decision boundaries for each AI agent. Use a change management matrix to assess rollout timelines and user impact. Prioritize use cases with short deployment cycles and minimal disruption. Favor agent scenarios that integrate with existing systems through documented APIs or connectors.

### Measure user desirability

Confirm that users or customers recognize the problem and accept an AI-driven solution. Collect evidence through interviews or surveys that show clear pain points and openness to change. Prioritize projects with strong user advocates and minimal resistance. AI agents only succeed when people use them consistently and trust their output.

## Define success metrics

Establish measurable success criteria for each AI agent use case before development begins. These success criteria must link directly to business outcomes such as reduced processing time, improved customer satisfaction scores, or increased operational efficiency. Success metrics define the expected return on investment and set the timeline for evaluation.

1. **Set baseline business goals.** Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that the AI agent must improve. For existing processes, measure current performance to establish a baseline. This baseline comparison enables accurate tracking of post-deployment impact. For new processes or early-stage businesses, estimate initial performance targets and refine these targets as operations mature.

1. **Use business metrics as decision gates.** Apply success criteria throughout the development lifecycle to guide investment decisions. Use these success metrics as checkpoints to determine whether the project continues, pivots, or stops. If a pilot fails to meet predefined benchmarks, reassess the use case or terminate the pilot initiative to avoid unnecessary cost and effort.

1. **Evaluate post-deployment performance.** Continue to measure success after integration. Compare actual results against target KPIs to determine whether the AI agent delivers expected value. If the AI agent underperforms, use the performance data to decide whether to refine the solution, retire the agent, or redirect resources to more promising opportunities.

This structured evaluation approach ensures that every AI agent initiative remains accountable to business value and supports continuous improvement across the portfolio.
