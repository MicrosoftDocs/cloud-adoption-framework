# Business strategy for AI agents

Successful agent adoption starts with a solid strategy that ties AI agents to business objectives, plus upfront planning around technology, people, and data. This preparation phase helps decision makers clarify why and where to use AI agents and how to organize for success.

## When to use AI agents?

AI agents are best suited for challenges involving complex reasoning, dynamic interaction, or unstructured data, especially when natural language is the most effective interface. These scenarios often align with digital transformation goals such as improving agility, reducing manual effort, and scaling personalization. Common examples include customer support automation, knowledge retrieval, workflow orchestration, and real-time insights generation.

1. **When not to use AI agents.** However, AI agents shouldn't be used to solve all productivity and process issues. If a problem can be solved with a simple script, automation tool, or existing software, those options should be prioritized. Misuse leads to wasted effort and unnecessary risk. A pilot is often the best way to validate feasibility and value.

2. **How to find use cases.** Encourage teams to explore proven patterns and validated use cases from other organizations. Resources like the [Microsoft Scenario Library](https://adoption.microsoft.com/scenario-library/) and [AI Use Cases catalog](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/use-case) provide valuable insights. Reviewing external examples helps avoid common pitfalls and accelerates solution design. Leaders should incorporate these resources into planning workshops and use them to benchmark internal ideas.

## How to prioritize AI agent use cases?

At this stage, it’s crucial to secure executive buy-in. Early wins with measurable value will help build momentum and obtain support for broader AI investments. Not all potential potential agent projects are equal. Focus on use cases that demonstrate value quickly and align with major strategic goals.

### Evaluate business impact

Evaluate potential projects based on expected ROI and feasibility. Look for high-value, low-complexity projects that can demonstrate quick wins. These use cases should be technically attainable and align with top business goals, such as cutting costs, improving customer satisfaction. Require a brief business case for each AI agent candidate, outlining how it will impact key KPIs, like "reduce support ticket handling time by 20% within 3 months".

### Measure technical feasibility

Evaluate whether the project is technically viable given current capabilities. Identify potential risks such as data quality issues, system dependencies, and operational complexity. Ensure each use case includes a clear definition of scope, autonomy level, and decision-making boundaries. Use a change management matrix to evaluate rollout timeframe and user impact. Prioritize use cases with short rollout times and low disruption. Focus on scenarios where AI agents can integrate seamlessly with existing systems through well-documented APIs or connectors.

### Measure user desirability

Ensure there is genuine demand from users or customers. An AI solution will only succeed if people actually use it. Gather evidence via surveys or interviews that target users have pain points an agent could address, and that they are open to an AI-driven solution. Favor projects with enthusiastic user champions and low resistance to change.

## Define success metrics

For each initiative, set clear, measurable success criteria tied to business outcomes, such as percentage reduction in processing time or increase in customer satisfaction scores. This establishes a target ROI and timeline. Also measure the baseline of current performance so you can compare post-deployment impact. Use these metrics as go/no-go gates during development. If a pilot isn’t meeting benchmarks, be ready to reassess or even cancel to avoid wasted investment.
