# AI agent adoption

Many organizations explore AI agents to automate processes, improve productivity, and enable new services. However, implementing AI agents is not a plug-and-play endeavor. It requires careful planning and governance to deliver real business value. The potential payoff is substantial when done right. This guide provides sequential milestones and prescriptive recommendations to plan, govern, build, integrate, and manage AI agents in a way that **maximizes return on investment (ROI)**, **minimizes risks**, **optimizes costs**, and **aligns teams effectively**.

## What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a microservice that can *reason*, *act*, and *learn* by combining a generative AI model with instructions, knowledge, and tools.

They operate as autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that respond to user messages, system events, or other agents. They use generative AI models to interpret instructions and process inputs. These instructions define the agent’s scope, specifying which actions to take or avoid. Agents use tools to retrieve knowledge, perform tasks, and maintain memory, enabling persistent and context-aware engagement. After gathering relevant inputs, the agent sends them to the language model, which generates an output. This output may be a user message, a response to another agent, or a summary of tool results. This structure allows agents to act independently while remaining aligned with enterprise goals. Examples include retrieval-based chatbots that answer questions using knowledge bases, task-focused agents that perform user-requested actions via APIs, or autonomous agents that execute proactive tasks based on events.
