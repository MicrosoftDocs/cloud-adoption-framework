# AI agent adoption

Many organizations explore AI agents to automate processes, improve productivity, and enable new services. However, implementing AI agents requires more than deploying a model or integrating a chatbot. It demands structured planning and governance to deliver measurable business value. When executed correctly, AI agents can transform operations and drive innovation across the cloud estate.

This guidance outlines sequential milestones and prescriptive recommendations to help organizations plan, govern, build, integrate, and manage AI agents. These steps aim to maximize return on investment (ROI), minimize risks, optimize costs, and align teams around shared objectives.

## What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a microservice that uses a generative AI model alongside instructions, knowledge, and tools to reason, act, and learn. These agents operate autonomously or semi-autonomously in response to user messages, system events, or other agents.

Each agent interprets instructions to determine its scope and actions. It uses tools to retrieve knowledge, perform tasks, and maintain memory, which enables persistent and context-aware engagement. After gathering inputs, the agent sends them to the language model, which generates an output, such as a user message, a response to another agent, or a summary of tool results. This structure allows agents to operate independently while remaining aligned with enterprise goals.

Organizations use different types of agents depending on their needs:

- **Retrieval agents** answer questions using knowledge bases.
- **Task agents** perform user-requested actions via APIs.
- **Autonomous agents** execute proactive tasks based on events.

## Why AI agents?

AI agents offer a scalable way to automate decision-making, streamline operations, and improve responsiveness across business functions. Their ability to interact through natural language and adapt to changing inputs makes them well-suited for environments with unstructured data, dynamic workflows, or complex logic.

Organizations use AI agents to reduce manual effort, accelerate innovation, and improve operational efficiency. However, the value of these agents depends on how well they integrate with existing systems and how directly they support business objectives.

## Next step

To realize the full potential of AI agents, organizations must align their adoption strategy with business outcomes. The next section explores how AI agents create internal and customer-facing impact—and how decision makers can guide their teams to use agents effectively across the enterprise.
