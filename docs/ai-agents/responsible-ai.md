# Responsible AI policy for AI Agents

Responsible AI defines how the organization designs and operates AI systems in an ethical, transparent, and accountable manner. This policy applies to every AI agent, regardless of its visibility or complexity. Microsoft provides a Responsible AI standard that organizations can use as a starting point and adapt to their own needs. For Azure AI Foundry, [Trustworthy AI resources](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-use-of-ai-overview).

## Establish a Responsible AI standard

Create a clear and consistent standard that applies to all AI agents across the organization. Align this standard with ethical principles such as fairness, privacy, and transparency, and ensure it complies with applicable laws and regulations. Integrate this standard into existing governance processes, including architecture reviews, security assessments, and compliance workflows. This integration helps teams apply consistent expectations and reduces the risk of ethical oversights as AI agents scale across the cloud environment.

Business leaders should treat this standard as a foundational policy that guides how teams design, deploy, and monitor AI systems. A well-defined standard simplifies oversight and accelerates deployment timelines by reducing rework and compliance delays.

## Assign ownership and oversight

Designate a responsible authority to manage and enforce the Responsible AI policy. This authority could be an AI ethics committee, the compliance office, or an AI Center of Excellence working with legal teams. Give this group the mandate to update policies, audit AI agents, and ensure compliance. Use automation to enforce standards where possible. For example, require safety features such as sensitive data protection in agent templates and verify them during code reviews or deployment pipelines.
Clear ownership reduces ambiguity, speeds up decision-making, and ensures accountability across teams. Business leaders should ensure this authority has the resources and influence to act across departments.

## Use Responsible AI for risk assessment

Apply Responsible AI principles to evaluate each AI workload. Use this structured approach to identify vulnerabilities and ethical concerns early. Tools like the Responsible AI dashboard help assess fairness, interpretability, and error rates. Refer to[Assess AI risks](../scenarios/ai/govern.md#assess-ai-organizational-risks).

Business leaders should direct teams to use these principles not only during development but also when reviewing existing systems. Early risk detection prevents reputational damage and reduces the cost of remediation.

## Monitor and improve AI systems

Define metrics that track ethical performance. Examples include refusal rates due to policy violations or user complaints about biased responses. Review these metrics regularly and direct teams to improve AI agents based on findings. Update policies and systems when regulations change. Use the Responsible AI dashboard to audit models for fairness, interpretability, and error analysis.
Continuous oversight ensures long-term compliance and keeps AI systems aligned with business values and legal requirements. Business leaders should treat these metrics as part of their operational dashboards and use them to guide investment and improvement decisions.
