# Enable success during a cloud adoption journey

The Cloud Adoption Framework is a free self-service tool that guides readers through various cloud adoption efforts. The framework helps customers succeed at realizing business objectives that can be enabled by Microsoft Azure. However, this content also recognizes that the reader may be addressing broad business, culture, or technical challenges and that sometimes might require a cloud-neutral position. Therefore, each section of this guidance begins with an Azure-first approach, and then follows with cloud-neutral theory that can scale across many business and technical decisions.

Throughout this framework, enablement is a core theme. The following checklist itemizes fundamental cloud adoption principles that ensure an adoption journey is considered successful by both IT and the business:

- **Plan:** Establishing clear [business outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md), a clearly defined [digital estate plan](../digital-estate/index.md), and well-understood [adoption backlogs](../migrate/migration-considerations/prerequisites/migration-backlog-review.md).
- **Ready:** Ensure the readiness of staff through [skills and learning plans](../ready/suggested-skills.md).
- **Operate:** Define a manageable operating model to guide activities during and long after adoption.
  - **[Organize](../organize/index.md):** Align people and teams to deliver proper cloud operations and adoption.
  - **Govern:** Align proper [governance disciplines](../govern/index.md) to consistently apply cost management, risk mitigation, compliance, and security baselines across all cloud adoption.
  - **Manage:** Ongoing [operational management](../manage/index.md) of the IT portfolio to minimize interruptions to business processes and ensure stability of the IT portfolio.
  - **Support:** Align proper [partnership and support options](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/partnership-options.md).

Another core theme is security, a critical quality attribute for a successful cloud adoption. Security is integrated throughout this framework to provide integrated guidance on maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances for your cloud workloads.

## Additional tools

In addition to the Cloud Adoption Framework, Microsoft covers additional topics that can enable success. This article highlights a few common tools that can significantly improve success beyond the scope of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Establishing cloud governance, resilient architectures, technical skills, and a DevOps approach are each important to the success of any cloud adoption effort. Bookmark this page as a resource to revisit throughout any cloud adoption journey.

- [**Cloud Governance**](../govern/guides/index.md)
  
  Understand business risk, map those risks to proper policies and processes. Using cloud governance tools and the Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance minimizes risks and improves the likelihood of success. Cloud governance helps control costs, create consistency, improve security, and accelerate deployment.

- [**Reliable Architecture (Resiliency)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview)
  
  Building a reliable application in the cloud is different from traditional application development. While historically you may have purchased levels of redundant higher-end hardware to minimize the chance of an entire application platform failing. In the cloud, we acknowledge up front that failures will happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component.

- [**Technical Skills Building**](../ready/suggested-skills.md)
  
  The greatest tool to aid in cloud adoption success is a well-trained team. Expand the skills of existing business and technical team members with the help of focused learning paths.

- [**DevOps Approach**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/)

  Microsoft's historic transformation is rooted firmly in a Growth Mindset approach to culture and a DevOps approach to technical execution. The Cloud Adoption Framework embeds both throughout the framework. To accelerate DevOps adoption, review the learning DevOps content.
  
- [**Azure Architecture Center**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/)
  
  Architecture solutions, reference architectures, example scenarios, best practices, and cloud design patterns to aid in the architecture of solutions running on Azure.

- [**Azure Pricing Calculator**](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator)
  
  Calculate the cost of various Azure components required to create or migration a chosen solution.

## Next steps

Armed with an understanding of the top enabling aspects of the Cloud Adoption Framework, the likelihood of success in a [Migrate](./migrate.md) or [Innovate](./innovate.md) effort will be that much higher.
