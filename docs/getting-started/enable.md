# Enable success during a cloud adoption journey

The Cloud Adoption Framework is a free self-service tool that guides readers through various cloud adoption efforts. The framework helps customers succeed at realizing business objectives that can be enabled by Microsoft Azure. However, this content also recognizes that the reader may be addressing broad business, culture, or technical challenges and that sometimes might require a cloud-neutral position. Therefore, each section of this guidance begins with an Azure-first approach, and then follows with cloud-neutral theory that can scale across many business and technical decisions.

Throughout this framework, enablement is a core theme. The following checklist itemizes fundamental cloud adoption principles that ensure an adoption journey is considered successful by both IT and the business:

- **Plan:** Establishing clear [business outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md), a clearly defined [digital estate plan](../digital-estate/index.md), and well-understood [adoption backlogs](../migrate/migration-considerations/prerequisites/migration-backlog-review.md).
- **Ready:** Ensure the readiness of staff through [skills and learning plans](../ready/technical-skills.md).
- **Operate:** Define a manageable operating model to guide activities during and long after adoption.
  - **[Organize](../organize/index.md):** Align people and teams to deliver proper cloud operations and adoption.
  - **Govern:** Align proper [governance disciplines](../govern/index.md) to consistently apply cost management, risk mitigation, compliance, and security baselines across all cloud adoption.
  - **Manage:** Ongoing [operational management](../manage/index.md) of the IT portfolio to minimize interruptions to business processes and ensure stability of the IT portfolio.
  - **Support:** Align proper [partnership and support options](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/partnership-options.md).

Another core theme is security, which is a critical quality attribute for a successful cloud adoption. Security is integrated throughout  this framework to provide integrated guidance on maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances for your cloud workloads. 

## Additional tools

In addition to the Cloud Adoption Framework, Microsoft covers additional topics that can enable success. This article highlights a few common tools that can significantly improve success beyond the scope of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Establishing cloud governance, resilient architectures, technical skills, and a DevOps approach are each important to the success of any cloud adoption effort. Bookmark this page as a resource to revisit throughout any cloud adoption journey.

While historically you may have purchased higher-end hardware to scale up, in a cloud environment you scale out instead of up.

## Next steps

Armed with an understanding of the top enabling aspects of the Cloud Adoption Framework, the likelihood of success in a [Migrate](./migrate.md) or [Innovate](./innovate.md) effort will be that much higher.
