# Innovate through cloud adoption

Cloud migration is an excellent option for your existing workloads. But creating new products and services requires a different approach. The innovate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework establishes an approach that guides the development of new products and services.

## Motivations behind innovation

Innovation isn't the right adoption path for every workload. An innovation path typically requires a larger investment in custom code and data management than other paths. Innovation also takes longer than migration or other forms of modernization. Follow this path when you're targeting the following business outcomes:

- Prepare for new technical capabilities.
- Scale to meet market demands.
- Scale to meet geographic demands.
- Build new technical capabilities.
- Improve customer experiences and engagements.
- Transform products or services.
- Disrupt the market with new products or services.

## Workloads associated with cloud innovation

Candidate workloads for cloud innovation include:

- Custom-built applications.
- Technology-based experiences.
- Integration of physical products and technology using IoT.
- Ambient intelligence: Integration of nonintrusive technology into an environment.
- Cognitive Services: Big Data, AI, Machine Learning, and predictive solutions.
