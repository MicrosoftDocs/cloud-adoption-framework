# Cloud Operating Model is now part of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

In early 2018, Microsoft released the Cloud Operating Model (COM). The COM was a guide that helped customers understand the *what* and the *why* of digital transformation. This helped customers get a sense of all the areas that needed to be addressed: business strategy, culture strategy, and technology strategy. What was not included in the COM were the specific *how-to* steps, which left customers wondering, "Where do we go from here?"

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, is designed to help you understand the **what** and **why** and provide unified guidance on the **how** to help accelerate your cloud adoption efforts.

## Using Cloud Operating Model practices within the Cloud Adoption Framework

For an approach that's similar to the COM, begin with one of the following:

- [Get started: Accelerate migration](../get-started/migrate.md)
- [Get started: Build and innovate in the cloud](../get-started/innovate.md)
- [Enable success with a sound operating model](../get-started/enable.md)
