PSRule for Azure includes tests that check how IaC is written and how Azure resources are configured. |
| [AzAdvertizer](https://www.azadvertizer.net) | Use AzAdvertizer to get Azure governance updates. For example, you can find insights about policy definitions, initiatives, aliases, security, and regulatory compliance controls in Azure Policy or Azure RBAC role definitions. You can also get insight into resource provider operations, Microsoft Entra role definitions and role actions, and Microsoft API permissions.|
