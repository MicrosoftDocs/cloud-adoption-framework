# Azure enterprise scaffold is now the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The Azure enterprise scaffold has been integrated into the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. The goals of the enterprise scaffold are now addressed in the [Ready methodology](../ready/index.md) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. The enterprise scaffold content has been deprecated.

To begin using the Cloud Adoption Framework, see:

- [Ready overview](../ready/index.md)
- [Azure landing zones](../ready/landing-zone/index.md)
- [Landing zone considerations](../ready/considerations/index.md).

If you need to review the deprecated content, see the [Azure enterprise scaffold](./migration-with-enterprise-scaffold.md).
