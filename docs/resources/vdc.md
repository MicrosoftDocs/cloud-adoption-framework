# Azure Virtual Datacenter

A more robust platform architecture and implementation have been created to build on the prior Azure Virtual Datacenter (VDC) approach. [Enterprise-scale landing zones](../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md) in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure are now the recommended approach for larger cloud-adoption efforts.

The following guidance serves as a significant part of the foundation for the [Ready methodology](../ready/index.md) and the [Govern methodology](../govern/index.md) in the Cloud Adoption Framework. To support customers making this transition, the following resources are archived and maintained in a separate GitHub repository.

- [Azure Virtual Datacenter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/archive/vdc/Azure_Virtual_Datacenter.pdf): This e-book shows you how to deploy enterprise workloads to the Azure cloud platform while respecting your existing security and networking policies.
- [Azure Virtual Datacenter lift-and-shift guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/archive/vdc/Azure_Virtual_Datacenter_Lift_and_Shift_Guide.pdf): This white paper discusses the process that enterprise IT staff and decision makers can use to identify and plan the migration of applications and servers to Azure using a lift-and-shift approach while minimizing other development costs and optimizing cloud hosting options.
