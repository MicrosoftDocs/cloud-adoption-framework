A rollback plan enables teams to quickly reverse changes when a deployment fails or introduces risk. A well-defined plan minimizes downtime, limits business impact, and maintains system reliability. Always establish rollback criteria and procedures before initiating any migration or deployment.

1. **Define failed deployment.** Collaborate with business stakeholders, workload owners, and operations teams to decide what counts as a failed deployment. Examples include failed health checks, poor performance, security issues, or unmet success metrics. This definition ensures rollback decisions align with your organization's risk tolerance. Include specific conditions that trigger a rollback in your deployment plan, such as CPU usage limits, response time thresholds, or error rates. This evaluation makes rollback decisions clear and consistent during incidents.

2. **Automate rollback steps in CI/CD pipelines.** Use tools like [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages) or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) to automate rollback processes. For example, configure pipelines to redeploy a previous version if health checks fail.

3. **Create workload-specific rollback instructions.** Develop rollback steps that match your workload type, environment, and deployment method. For example, infrastructure-as-code deployments require reapplying previous templates. Application rollbacks involve redeploying a prior container image. Attach rollback scripts, configuration snapshots, and infrastructure-as-code templates to your rollback plan. These assets enable rapid execution and reduce dependence on manual intervention.

4. **Test rollback procedures.** Simulate deployment failures in a preproduction environment to validate rollback effectiveness. Identify and resolve gaps in automation, permissions, or dependencies. Confirm that rollback restores the system to a stable, known-good state.

5. **Improve rollback strategies** After each deployment or rollback event, conduct a retrospective to assess what worked and what didnâ€™t. Update rollback criteria, procedures, and automation based on lessons learned, architectural changes, or new tooling. Maintain documentation to ensure rollback strategies remain current and effective.
