## Common customer challenges and supporting guidance

**Prepare for centralized operations or cloud center of excellence:** Review the [Cloud Adoption Framework](../../get-started/index.md) articles. Establish the processes and approaches required to support your workloads.

**Monitor assets across an existing retail portfolio:** Focus on the govern and manage articles to integrate Azure into your existing operations processes. Use the ready article to deploy those improvements across all of your cloud environments.

**Influence changes to individual workloads (Central IT/Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)):** As controls improve, the central IT teams will need to know the architectures that handle the workloads. Use the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/) guidance to help workload owners improve the handling of the workloads.

**Optimize individual workloads (workload teams):** Workload owners should start with the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review&mode=pre-assessment) guidance to understand the best ways to handle their workloads to support company business strategies. A central IT or CCoE team that supports the workload can use the guidance for insights into best practices and architectures to accelerate implementation.

**Implement specific Azure products:** Use Azure products outlined in the featured products section to improve and accelerate your implementation.
