# Azure for Retail

We are at an inflection point unlike any other that we've seen before. Retail is being reimagined. The challenges are real. Intense industry disruption, changing consumer expectations, and the need for differentiation to stay relevant. But the opportunities are endless.

Microsoft enables retail organizations to transform their business and deliver extraordinary customer service using an intelligent, trusted, and secure cloud platform.

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/) offers a wide range of products and services, all with the speed and scale of the cloud. Our databases and storage services make it possible to connect and combine data silos. This combination enables the creation of a digital feedback loop. Digital signals in this loop, such as customer demand, commerce, payments, and distribution, can be captured across the retail value chain. The data can then be connected and synthesized to drive improved business outcomes.

We also have advanced analytics and AI solutions that help retailers gain actionable intelligence and develop intelligent applications. We have a leading position in key twenty-first century technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and mixed reality. For developers, we have a comprehensive set of tools. These tools can be used with any platform or language to build and manage cloud applications.

We aren't limited to the public cloud either. We provide unique hybrid capabilities that give you the flexibility to innovate in any environment. Microsoft is unique in offering cloud services delivered at the edge or on-premises. This edge computing environment is valuable for retail organizations. These organizations need both modern services and the resiliency on-site computing offers environments. For example, stores and distribution centers that operate around the clock. Security, privacy, compliance, and manageability are key differentiators across our portfolio.

There are several providers with exciting capabilities in the retail cloud space. However, most of them offer only a subset of what's required to achieve true transformation. Their business models are often rooted in revenue derived from either advertising or commerce. Meaning that to some degree, they're competing with retailers.

Microsoft is the only cloud provider to offer all the capabilities that retailers need for modernization. Our business model is about contribution, not competition. Our success is contingent upon our customers' success. We draw on the experiences from our own digital transformation to help customers reach the best possible outcomes with their own transformation.
