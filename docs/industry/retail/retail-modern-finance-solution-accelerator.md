# Identify key revenue factors with a Modern Finance Solution Accelerator

## Modern Finance Solution Accelerator introduction

Many businesses have separate systems for invoice, revenue, and user behavior data. With disparate datasets and traditional analytics methods, it can be challenging to correlate data and identify what the top factors for revenue growth are for your organization. So, what common challenges do you face in calculating possible future growth trajectories for your company?

## Customer challenges

- Invoice and revenue data housed in different systems than point of sale or behavioral data
- Hard to predict what's leading growth—caused by multiple locations, promotions, and brand data
- Hard to track the effectiveness and prioritization of loyalty programs
- Importing data from multiple sources like clickstream and billing data

The Modern Finance Solution Accelerator changes the way we deliver an impact across how all of finance works. The surplus value for you is created by your spending less time performing transactional activities, and more time delivering insights to drive better business decisions for your organization.

- Financial analysis and reporting – transforming legacy systems and tools to increase insight and productivity
- Strategy and forecasting – driving forward-looking forecasting and strategic decision making
- Business process automation – enabling greater efficiency through chat bots and automated workflows
- Risk and compliance – harnessing technology to mitigate and proactively control risk
