# Improve retail experience with a Retail Recommender Solution Accelerator

In the retail world, digital channels have rapidly become the driving force towards creating improved customer engagement. Retailers are being pushed to reimagine the way they communicate value proposition, sharing updates on their product lines. They are being forced to move towards the perspective of the purchasing consumer—aiming to better understand what customers are looking for. Retailers are seeking fresh ways to strengthen the connection between shoppers and products—increasing their attach rate, and creating additive value beyond the products in shopping carts.

Onsite shopping typically leads to impulse buying, as shoppers have a variety of products displayed before them. Impulse buying doesn't typically occur in the online shopping experience. Shoppers look for specific products, add to their basket, and proceed to checkout.

The Retail Recommender Solution Accelerator helps retailers highlight associated products that might be of interest to a shopper. Its purpose is to create a personalized online shopping experience. Using AI and advanced data analytics cloud technologies, the Retail Recommender Solution Accelerator presents shoppers with relevant content and products in the following ways:

- A shopper visits a retailer online commercial page, which prompts the user with personalized selections, based on purchase history.
- When the shopper adds items to the cart, the site offers more recommendations, based on what products would be purchased with these items.
- As the shopper moves around the retailer's site, the site offers new recommendations based on what the shopper looks at.

## Transform customer experience with real-time personalization

The Retail Recommender Solution Accelerator uses machine learning and a filtering model that connects what the customer looks at with data from what other users have in real time to provide a recommendation. For example, if other customers viewed phones and headsets, and you view phones, you are more likely to view a headset as well—an that particular customer view will become your recommendation. The system will then construct a matrix of similar data to inform your future recommendations.

Here is what the Retail Recommender Solution Accelerator model looks like:
