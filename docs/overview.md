# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a comprehensive guide designed to help organizations succeed in their cloud journey. It offers end-to-end guidance across the entire lifecycle of cloud adoption, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

Developed from real-world experiences by Microsoft experts, partners, and customers, the framework is a self-service resource available to all Azure users. It provides foundational guidance that every organization should follow, while also pointing to more specialized content as needed throughout your journey.

## Who is the Cloud Adoption Framework for?

The Cloud Adoption Framework is for anyone seeking to succeed with Azure—whether you're just starting out or managing a large-scale cloud environment. It supports:

- Startups and enterprises alike
- New Azure users learning best practices
- Existing customers looking to mature their cloud capabilities

While there are similarities with other cloud platforms, Azure has unique considerations. The framework helps you navigate those differences and adopt Azure in a way that aligns with your business goals.

## How to Use the Cloud Adoption Framework

The framework is organized into key methodologies that guide you through each phase of your Azure adoption journey:

1. **Strategy** – Define your business justification and desired outcomes for adopting Azure.
2. **Plan** – Prepare your people, processes, and technology to execute your strategy.
3. **Ready** – Build a secure, governed Azure environment and create landing zones for your workloads.
4. **Adopt** – Migrate existing workloads to Azure (on-prem or from other clouds), modernize, or build new cloud-native solutions in Azure.
5. **Govern, Secure, and Manage** – Continuously govern, secure, and manage your Azure environment to ensure long-term success.

Each methodology builds on the previous one, helping you move from planning to execution with confidence.
