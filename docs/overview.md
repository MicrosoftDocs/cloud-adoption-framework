# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is your step-by-step guide to success in the Azure. It helps you plan, build, and manage your Azure environment. It covers decisions about people, processes, and technology.

## Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides guidance based on real-world experience to help you succeed in Azure. It gives you a roadmap to follow no matter where you are in your cloud journey. You get guidance you need, when you need it. It integrates with the Well-Architected Framework and Azure Architecture Center to help you design and build solutions in Azure.

## Who should use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

This Cloud Adoption Framework is for anyone using Azure. Whether you're just starting or already running workloads in the cloud, it helps you make smart decisions. It supports:

- **Startups** launching a business in Azure.
- **Enterprises** operating at a massive scale.
- **New users** building foundational Azure skills.

## How to use the Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework organizes its guidance into methodologies that support each phase of your Azure journey. Four methodologies form a sequential path: **Strategy**, **Plan**, **Ready**, and **Adopt**. You complete these methodologies in order to establish your Azure foundation and deploy workloads. Three methodologies run continuously: **Govern**, **Secure**, and **Manage**. You implement these methodologies alongside the sequential ones and refine them as your Azure environment evolves.
