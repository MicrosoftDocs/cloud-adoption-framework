# What Is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure** is an end-to-end guide designed to help you succeed in Azure. It provides structured, actionable guidance for every stage of your Azure adoption journey. The framework helps align people, processes, and technology to accelerate decision-making and drive successful outcomes.

## Why Use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

Microsoft experts in collaboration with partners and customers developed the Cloud Adoption Framework based on real-world experiences. It serves as a roadmap for all Azure users. It provides specialized guidance tailored to different stages and scenarios of cloud adoption. It also helps organizations transition from their current environment to Azure the right way.

## Who Should Use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

This framework is designed for anyone aiming to succeed with Azure, regardless of organization size or cloud maturity. It supports:

- **Startups** launching their business in Azure.
- **Enterprises** scaling operations across global environments.
- **New users** building foundational Azure skills.
- **Existing customers** enhancing governance, security, and operational excellence.

It empowers decision-makers to make informed choices that impact people, processes, and technology.

## How to Use the Cloud Adoption Framework

The framework is organized into key methodologies that guide you through each phase of your Azure adoption journey. **Strategy**, **Plan**, **Ready**, and **Adopt** are foundational methodologies that help to migrate workloads to Azure or build them in Azure natively. **Govern**, **Secure**, and **Manage** are continuous methodologies that begin early and evolve throughout your cloud lifecycle.
