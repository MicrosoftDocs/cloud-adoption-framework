# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides comprehensive guidance to help organizations successfully adopt Azure cloud technologies. This framework delivers a structured approach for planning, deploying, and operating cloud solutions that align with business goals while achieving faster, more cost-effective cloud adoption.

## Quick start options

Choose your starting point based on where you are in your cloud journey:

- **New to Azure?** [Define your cloud strategy and business goals](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) to align stakeholders and set success metrics
- **Ready to build infrastructure?** [Set up Azure landing zones](./ready/landing-zone/index.md) for a secure, scalable cloud foundation
- **Have workloads to migrate?** [Plan your migration approach](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/plan-migration) with proven migration strategies
- **Looking for specific solutions?** [Explore cloud adoption scenarios](#cloud-adoption-scenarios) for AI, analytics, hybrid, and more

## Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework delivers proven guidance and best practices that accelerate your Azure cloud adoption journey. This comprehensive framework helps you:

- **Reduce risk** with battle-tested methodologies used by thousands of organizations
- **Optimize costs** by following proven patterns for efficient cloud resource management
- **Accelerate migration** with clear roadmaps for planning, migrating, and optimizing workloads
- **Ensure compliance** through integrated governance and security best practices

The framework integrates with the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/) to provide end-to-end guidance for designing, building, and managing secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions.

## Who should use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework serves organizations across all industries and sizes pursuing Azure cloud adoption. Whether you're just starting your cloud journey or optimizing existing deployments, find guidance tailored to your needs:

| **Enterprises**     | Managing large-scale operations and complex, hybrid and multicloud environments.                |
| **New users**       | Building foundational skills and understanding of Azure.                                        |
| **Existing customers** | Looking to mature and optimize their cloud operations.                                       |

## How to use the Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework organizes Azure guidance into seven core methodologies that guide your complete cloud adoption journey. These methodologies include both foundational phases for establishing your Azure environment and operational phases for ongoing cloud management. Foundational methodologies follow a sequential approach to build your Azure foundation and deploy workloads, while operational methodologies run continuously throughout your cloud operations.

### Foundational methodologies

| CAF methodology | Outcome | How to |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| üöÄ [**1. Strategy**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) | Align cloud adoption to business goals. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework to map business drivers to measurable cloud outcomes. |
| üìù [**2. Plan**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) | Create a custom plan to adopt the cloud. | Prepare people, processes, and technology for transformation. Understand the costs of the cloud. |
| üõ†Ô∏è [**3. Ready**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) | Ready the Azure environment to host workloads and scale. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Architecture Center to establish foundational governance and to deploy the Azure platform landing zones that you need. You plug Azure application landing zones into this foundation. |
| üåê [**4. Adopt**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/adopt/) | Deploy workloads in Azure that align to business needs. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, the Azure Architecture Center, and the Well-Architected Framework to design and deploy workloads to Azure application landing zones. Use application Azure landing zone accelerators for faster, repeatable deployments. |

### Operational methodologies

These are three separate, parallel, and continuous phases of the cloud. You might think of these as ongoing operations. You start building toward these in the Strategy and Plan phases, but they become operational as your workloads move into production.

| CAF methodology  | Outcome | How to |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| üõ°Ô∏è [**5. Govern**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/) | Maintain control and compliance. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, the Azure Architecture Center, and the Well-Architected Framework to define governance policies, enforce compliance, and manage costs. |
| üîí [**6. Secure**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/) | Protect workloads against evolving threats. | Implement security controls, monitor threats, and execute incident response to reduce risk and protect assets. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è [**7. Manage**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) | Ensure operational excellence. | Optimize performance, maintain availability, and drive continuous improvement in operations. |

## Cloud adoption scenarios

CAF also provides scenario-based guidance tailored to specific technologies and business needs. These scenarios apply the framework‚Äôs principles to real-world use cases, offering actionable steps and best practices.

| CAF Scenario | Description |
|--------------|-----------------|
| [AI adoption](./scenarios/ai/index.md) | Implement AI solutions in Azure effectively and responsibly. |
| [Azure VMware Solution](./scenarios/azure-vmware/index.md) | Migrate VMware workloads to Azure with minimal disruption. |
| [Cloud-Scale Analytics](./scenarios/data-management/index.md) | Build secure, scalable, and modern data platforms. |
| [Hybrid and Multicloud](./scenarios/hybrid/index.md) | Integrate on-premises, Azure, and other cloud environments. |
| [Modern Application Platform](./scenarios/app-platform/index.md) | Modernize apps using containers, microservices, and PaaS. |
| [Oracle on Azure](./scenarios/oracle-on-azure/index.md) | Run and manage Oracle workloads in Azure. |
