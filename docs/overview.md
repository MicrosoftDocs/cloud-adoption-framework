# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a comprehensive guide designed to help organizations successfully adopt cloud technologies. It provides a structured approach to achieving business goals through Azure, enabling faster, more cost-effective cloud adoption.

## Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework offers proven guidance to support informed decision-making at every stage of your cloud journey. Whether you're planning, migrating, or optimizing, the framework:

- Provides a clear roadmap tailored to your needs.
- Aligns with the Well-Architected Framework and the Azure Architecture Center.
- Helps you design, build, and manage secure, scalable, and resilient solutions in Azure.

## Who should use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The framework is valuable for anyone working with Azure, regardless of experience or scale. It supports:

- **Startups** launching a business in Azure. Explore [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/startups) for Azure credits and resources.
- **Enterprises** managing large-scale operations and complex, hybrid and multicloud environments.
- **New users** building foundational skills and understanding of Azure.
- **Existing customers** looking to mature and optimize their cloud operations.

## How to use the Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) organizes its guidance into methodologies that support every part of your Azure journey. There are foundational methodologies and operational methodologies. Foundational methodologies are sequential and help you establish your Azure foundation and deploy workloads. Operational methodologies are implemented in parallel with the foundational methodologies but are ongoing as part of your operations.

### Foundational methodologies

| CAF methodology | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| üöÄ [**1. Strategy**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) | Define business justification and expected outcomes. |
| üìù [**2. Plan**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) | Align cloud adoption plans with business goals. |
| üõ†Ô∏è [**3. Ready**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) | Prepare your Azure environment and landing zones. |
| üåê **4. Adopt** | [Migrate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/plan-migration) workload from on-premises or other clouds. <br> [Modernize](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/modernize/) existing workloads to better meet business needs.<br> [Build](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/) new cloud-native workloads and features in Azure. |

### Operational domains of cloud adoption

| CAF methodology | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| üõ°Ô∏è [**Govern**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/) | Establish governance to manage risks. |
| üîí [**Secure**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/) | Protect your Azure environment. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è [**Manage**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) |  Operate and optimize your cloud environment. |
