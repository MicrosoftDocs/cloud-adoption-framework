## Understand the lifecycle

Each methodology above is part of a broad cloud adoption lifecycle. The Cloud Adoption Framework is a full lifecycle framework, supporting customers throughout each phase of adoption by providing methodologies as specific approaches to overcoming common blockers, as shown here.

## Intent

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure, use, and secure technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership of and responsibility for all aspects of technology, from infrastructure to software. By moving to the cloud, enterprises can provision and consume resources only when they're needed. Although the cloud offers tremendous flexibility in design choices, enterprises need a proven and consistent methodology for adopting cloud technologies. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure meets that need, helping guide decisions throughout cloud adoption.

But cloud adoption is only a means to an end. Successful cloud adoption starts well before a cloud platform vendor is selected. It begins when business and IT decision makers realize that the cloud can accelerate a specific business transformation objective. The Cloud Adoption Framework helps align strategies for business, culture, and technical change to achieve their desired business outcomes.

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides technical guidance for Microsoft Azure. Because enterprise customers might still be in the process of choosing a cloud vendor or might have an intentional multicloud strategy, the framework provides cloud-agnostic guidance for strategic decisions whenever possible.

## Intended audience

This guidance affects the business, technology, and culture of enterprises. The affected roles include line-of-business leaders, business decision makers, IT decision makers, finance, enterprise administrators, IT operations, IT security and compliance, IT governance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners. Each role uses its own vocabulary, and each has different objectives and key performance indicators. A single set of content can't address all audiences effectively.

Enter the *cloud architect*. The cloud architect serves as the thought leader and facilitator to bring these audiences together. We've designed this collection of guides to help cloud architects facilitate the right conversations with the right audiences and drive decision-making. Business transformation that's empowered by the cloud depends on the cloud architect role to help guide decisions throughout the business and IT.

Each section of the Cloud Adoption Framework represents a different specialization or variant of the cloud architect role. These sections also create opportunities to share cloud architecture responsibilities across a team of cloud architects. For example, the governance section is designed for cloud architects who have a passion for mitigating technical risks. Some cloud providers refer to these specialists as cloud custodians; we prefer the term *cloud guardian* or, collectively, the *cloud governance team*.
