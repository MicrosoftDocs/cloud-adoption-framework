# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a structured roadmap that helps organizations successfully adopt Azure and integrate cloud technologies into their existing enterprise architecture.

Foundational methodologies flow sequentially. Operational methodologies run in parallel during operations." lightbox="caf-overview.png" border="false":::

## How does the Cloud Adoption Framework work?

The Cloud Adoption Framework organizes Azure guidance into seven core methodologies or phases that orchestrate your complete cloud transformation journey. The Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt are sequential steps to build Azure foundations (foundational phases). It's where you start if you're new and revisit if you need to improve aspects of your Azure adoption. After you have workloads in Azure, you start executing the Govern, Secure, Manage (operational phases).

| CAF methodology (phases) | Outcome | How |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| 🚀 [**1. Strategy**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) | Cloud adoption aligned to business goals | Pap business drivers to cloud outcomes. |
| 📝 [**2. Plan**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) | A plan for cloud adoption | Operating model, cloud skills, migration plan, and cloud cost estimation. |
| 🛠️ [**3. Ready**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) | An Azure environment ready for workloads | Azure purchasing, tenant setup, platform landing zone, application landing zones. |
| 🌐 [**4. Adopt**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/adopt/) | Workloads in Azure meeting business needs | Migrate, modernize, or build-cloud native workloads. |
| 🛡️ [**5. Govern**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/) | Control workloads | Assess cloud risks and mitigate with Azure and Microsoft tools. |
| 🔒 [**6. Secure**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/) | Protect workloads | Apply security control with with Azure and Microsoft tools. |
| ⚙️ [**7. Manage**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) | Optimize workloads | Administer workloads with Azure and Microsoft tools. |

## Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework addresses the critical challenges that commonly cause cloud adoption projects to exceed budget or timeline expectations. This comprehensive methodology eliminates common failure points through structured guidance for Azure cloud transformation:

- **Reduce migration risks significantly** with methodologies validated across thousands of organizational deployments spanning Fortune 500 enterprises to startups
- **Optimize cloud costs effectively** through proven patterns for resource rightsizing, cost governance, and operational efficiency best practices
- **Accelerate deployment timelines substantially** with prescriptive roadmaps for planning, migrating, and optimizing workloads at enterprise scale
- **Ensure security and compliance from day one** through integrated governance frameworks and security controls aligned with industry standards (SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- **Avoid common pitfalls** that derail cloud projects, including governance gaps, security vulnerabilities, and cost overruns

The framework integrates seamlessly with the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/) to deliver end-to-end guidance for designing, building, and managing secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions that meet enterprise requirements.

## Who is the Cloud Adoption Framework for?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework serves organizations across all industries and scales pursuing strategic Azure cloud adoption. This framework adapts to your specific cloud maturity level, from initial Azure evaluation through advanced multi-cloud optimization strategies.

| Organization Type   | How the framework accelerates success   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Startups**        | Build cloud-native applications using best practices. Access [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/startups) for Azure credits and technical resources. |
| **Enterprise**     | Establish a governance foundation to control workloads at enterprise scale. |
