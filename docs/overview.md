## How does the Cloud Adoption Framework work?

The Cloud Adoption Framework organizes Azure guidance into seven core methodologies that orchestrate your complete cloud transformation journey. These methodologies follow a strategic progression: foundational phases establish secure Azure environments and deploy workloads, while operational phases deliver continuous cloud management, security, and optimization.

**The Cloud Adoption Framework architecture explained**: The framework operates as a dual-phase transformation roadmap. The foundational methodologies (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) execute sequentially to build enterprise-grade Azure foundations, while the operational methodologies (Govern, Secure, Manage) run in parallel throughout your cloud lifecycle to ensure sustained success and operational excellence.

### Foundational methodologies: Building enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure

The foundational phase executes a systematic approach to establish secure cloud presence and deploy production-ready workloads with built-in governance and compliance controls.

| CAF methodology | Strategic outcome | Implementation approach |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| üöÄ [**1. Strategy**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) | Align cloud adoption initiatives to measurable business goals and ROI targets. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework to map business drivers to quantifiable cloud outcomes and establish success metrics. |
| üìù [**2. Plan**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) | Create a comprehensive, stakeholder-aligned plan for cloud transformation. | Prepare people, processes, and technology infrastructure for digital transformation while establishing realistic timelines and budget parameters. |
| üõ†Ô∏è [**3. Ready**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) | Deploy enterprise-ready Azure environments that scale securely. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Architecture Center to establish foundational governance controls and deploy Azure platform landing zones with integrated security. |
| üåê [**4. Adopt**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/adopt/) | Deploy production workloads in Azure that deliver business value. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, Azure Architecture Center, and Well-Architected Framework to architect and deploy workloads to Azure application landing zones with automated deployment accelerators. |

### Operational methodologies: Ensuring sustained cloud excellence

The operational phase runs continuously to maintain security, optimize performance, and ensure compliance across your Azure environment. These three methodologies operate in parallel to deliver operational excellence that scales with your business growth.

**Best practice**: Begin operational excellence planning during Strategy and Plan phases, as these methodologies become mission-critical when workloads reach production scale and serve business-critical functions.

| CAF methodology  | Strategic outcome | Implementation approach |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| üõ°Ô∏è [**5. Govern**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/) | Maintain enterprise control, compliance, and cost optimization. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, Azure Architecture Center, and Well-Architected Framework to define governance policies, automate compliance enforcement, and implement cost management strategies. |
| üîí [**6. Secure**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/) | Protect workloads against evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. | Implement zero-trust security controls, deploy continuous threat monitoring, and execute incident response procedures to minimize risk and protect critical assets. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è [**7. Manage**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) | Ensure operational excellence and continuous optimization. | Optimize application performance, maintain high availability SLAs, and drive continuous improvement through automation, monitoring, and DevOps best practices. |
