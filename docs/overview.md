# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure delivers comprehensive, step-by-step guidance for cloud adoption success. This framework enables organizations to plan, deploy, and operate Azure cloud solutions that drive measurable business outcomes while minimizing risks and maximizing return on investment.

## How does the Cloud Adoption Framework work?

The Cloud Adoption Framework organizes Azure guidance into seven core methodologies or phases that orchestrate your complete cloud transformation journey. The foundational methodologies (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) execute sequentially to build enterprise-grade Azure foundations, while the operational methodologies (Govern, Secure, Manage) run in parallel throughout your cloud lifecycle to ensure sustained success and operational excellence.

| CAF methodology | Strategic outcome | Implementation approach |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| 🚀 [**1. Strategy**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/) | Align cloud adoption initiatives to measurable business goals and ROI targets. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework to map business drivers to quantifiable cloud outcomes and establish success metrics. |
| 📝 [**2. Plan**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) | Create a comprehensive, stakeholder-aligned plan for cloud transformation. | Prepare people, processes, and technology infrastructure for digital transformation while establishing realistic timelines and budget parameters. |
| 🛠️ [**3. Ready**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) | Deploy enterprise-ready Azure environments that scale securely. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Architecture Center to establish foundational governance controls and deploy Azure platform landing zones with integrated security. |
| 🌐 [**4. Adopt**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/adopt/) | Deploy production workloads in Azure that deliver business value. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, Azure Architecture Center, and Well-Architected Framework to architect and deploy workloads to Azure application landing zones with automated deployment accelerators. |
| 🛡️ [**5. Govern**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/) | Maintain enterprise control, compliance, and cost optimization. | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework, Azure Architecture Center, and Well-Architected Framework to define governance policies, automate compliance enforcement, and implement cost management strategies. |
| 🔒 [**6. Secure**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/) | Protect workloads against evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. | Implement zero-trust security controls, deploy continuous threat monitoring, and execute incident response procedures to minimize risk and protect critical assets. |
| ⚙️ [**7. Manage**](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) | Ensure operational excellence and continuous optimization. | Optimize application performance, maintain high availability SLAs, and drive continuous improvement through automation, monitoring, and DevOps best practices. |

## Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework addresses the critical challenges that commonly cause cloud adoption projects to exceed budget or timeline expectations. This comprehensive methodology eliminates common failure points through structured guidance for Azure cloud transformation:

- **Reduce migration risks significantly** with methodologies validated across thousands of organizational deployments spanning Fortune 500 enterprises to startups
- **Optimize cloud costs effectively** through proven patterns for resource rightsizing, cost governance, and operational efficiency best practices
- **Accelerate deployment timelines substantially** with prescriptive roadmaps for planning, migrating, and optimizing workloads at enterprise scale
- **Ensure security and compliance from day one** through integrated governance frameworks and security controls aligned with industry standards (SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- **Avoid common pitfalls** that derail cloud projects, including governance gaps, security vulnerabilities, and cost overruns

The framework integrates seamlessly with the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/) to deliver end-to-end guidance for designing, building, and managing secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions that meet enterprise requirements.

## Who is the Cloud Adoption Framework for?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework serves organizations across all industries and scales pursuing strategic Azure cloud adoption. This framework adapts to your specific cloud maturity level, from initial Azure evaluation through advanced multi-cloud optimization strategies.

| Organization Type   | How the framework accelerates success   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Technology Startups**        | Build cloud-native applications from inception using proven architectural patterns and DevOps best practices. Access [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/startups) for Azure credits and technical resources. |
| **Enterprise Organizations**     | Navigate complex multi-workload migrations, hybrid cloud architectures, and large-scale operations with enterprise governance, security controls, and compliance frameworks. |
| **New Azure adopters** | Accelerate Azure learning through structured guidance, hands-on labs, and architectural best practices that prevent common implementation mistakes. |
| **Existing Azure customers** | Optimize current Azure deployments, implement advanced cost management strategies, and mature cloud operations through automation and monitoring. |
