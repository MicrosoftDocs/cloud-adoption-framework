# What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a comprehensive guide designed to help organizations succeed in their cloud journey. It offers end-to-end guidance across the entire lifecycle of cloud adoption, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

Developed from real-world experiences by Microsoft experts, partners, and customers, the framework is a self-service resource available to all Azure users.
