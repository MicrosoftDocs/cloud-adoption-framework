# Transition existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture

We recognize that most organizations may have an existing footprint in Azure, one or more subscriptions, and potentially an existing structure of their management groups. Depending on their initial business requirements and scenarios, Azure resources such as hybrid connectivity (for example with Site-to-Site VPN or ExpressRoute) may have been deployed.

This article helps organizations to navigate the right path based on an existing Azure environment transitioning into the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture. This article also describes considerations for moving resources in Azure (for example, moving a subscription from one existing management group to another management group), which will help you evaluate and plan for transitioning your existing Azure environment.

## Moving resources in Azure

Some resources in Azure can be moved post creation, and there are different approaches organizations can take subject to users Azure RBAC permissions at - and across scopes. The following table outlines which resources can be moved, at which scope, and the pros/cons associated with each.

| Scope | Destination | Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- | ---- |
| Resources in resource groups | Can be moved to new resource group in same or different subscription | Allows you to modify resource composition in a resource group after deployment | - Not supported by all resourceTypes <br> - Some resourceTypes have specific limitations or requirements <br> - resourceIds are updated and impacts existing monitoring, alerts, and control plane operations <br> - resource groups are locked during the move period <br> - Requires assessment of policies and RBAC pre and post-move operation |
| Subscriptions in a tenant | Can be moved to different management groups | No impact to existing resources within the subscription, as no resourceId values will be changed | Requires assessment of policies and RBAC pre and post-move operation |

To understand which move strategy you should use, we will go through examples of both:

## Subscription move

The common use cases for moving subscriptions are to organize subscriptions into management groups or when transferring subscriptions to a new Azure Active Directory tenant. Subscription moves focuses on moving subscriptions to management groups. Moving a subscription to a new tenant is mainly for [transferring billing ownership](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/billing-subscription-transfer). For more guidance about how to move subscriptions across management groups in the same tenant, see [Moving management groups and subscriptions](/azure/governance/management-groups/manage#moving-management-groups-and-subscriptions).

### Azure RBAC requirements

To assess a subscription prior to a move, it's important that the user has the appropriate Azure RBAC such as being an owner on the subscription (direct role assignment), and has write permission on the target management group (built-in roles that support this are the Owner role, the Contributor role, and the Management Group Contributor role).

If the user has an inherited Owner role permission on the subscription from an existing management group, the subscription can only be moved to the management group where the user has been assigned the Owner role.

### Policy

Existing subscriptions may be subject to Azure policies assigned either directly, or at the management group where they are currently located. It's important to assess current policies, and the policies that may exist in the new management group/management group hierarchy.

Azure Resource Graph can be used to perform an inventory of existing resources and compare their configuration with the policies existing at the destination.

Once subscriptions are moved to a management group with existing Azure RBAC and policies in place, consider the following options:

- Any Azure RBAC that is inherited to the moved subscriptions can take up to 30 minutes before the user tokens in the management group cache are refreshed. To expedite this process, you can refresh the token by signing out and in or request a new token.
- Any policy where the assignment scope includes the moved subscriptions, will perform audit operations only on the existing resources. More specifically:
  - Any existing resource in the subscription subject to a `DeployIfNotExists` policy effect will appear as noncompliant and will not be remediated automatically but requires user interaction to perform the remediation manually.
  - Any existing resource in the subscription subject to `Deny` policy effect will appear as noncompliant and will not be rejected. User must manually mitigate this result as appropriate.
  - Any existing resource in the subscription subject to `Append` and `Modify` policy effect will appear as noncompliant and requires user interaction to mitigate.
  - Any existing resource in the subscription subject to `Audit` and `AuditIfNotExist` policy effect will appear as noncompliant and requires user interaction to mitigate.
- All new writes to resources in the moved subscription is subject to the assigned policies at real-time as normal.

## Resource move

The primary use cases to perform a resource move is when you want to consolidate resources into the same resource group if they share the same lifecycle, or move resources to a different subscription due to cost, ownership, or Azure RBAC requirements.

When performing a resource move, both the source resource group and the target resource group are locked (this lock will not affect any of the resources in the resource group) during the move operation, meaning you cannot add, update, or delete resources in the resource groups. A resource move operation will not change the location of the resources.

For more guidance about how to move resources across resource groups and subscriptions in the same tenant, see [Move resources to a new resource group or subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription).

### Before you move resources

Prior to a move operation, you must verify that the [resources in scope are supported](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources) as well as assessing their requirements and dependencies. For instance, moving a peered virtual network requires you to disable virtual network peering first, and reenable the peering once the move operation has completed. This disable/reenable dependency requires planning upfront to understand the impact to any existing workload that may be connected to your virtual networks.

### Post-move operation

When the resources are moved into a new resource group in the same subscription, any inherited Azure RBAC and policies from management group or/and subscription scope will still apply. If you move to a resource group in a new subscription - where the subscription may be subject to other Azure RBAC and policy assignment, same guidance applies as to the move subscription scenario to validate the resource compliance and access controls.

## Scenarios

We have provided guidance in [Scenarios: Transitioning existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](./../landing-zone/align-scenarios.md) for common scenarios that our customers may match, or be similar to, that they wish to migrate and transition from into the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture.
