# Implement enterprise-scale landing zones in Azure

When business requirements necessitate a rich initial implementation of landing zones with fully integrated governance, security, and operations from the start, Microsoft suggests using the enterprise-scale example options on this page. This approach can use the Microsoft Azure portal or infrastructure as code to set up and configure your environment. It's also possible to transition between the portal and infrastructure as code (recommended) when your organization is ready. As with any other Microsoft Azure infrastructure-as-code approach, you'll need Azure Resource Manager templates and GitHub skills.

## Example implementation

The table below lists example modular implementations.

| Example deployment  | Description  | GitHub repo | Deploy to Azure |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Enterprise-scale foundation | This is the suggested foundation for enterprise-scale adoption. | [Example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/master/docs/reference/wingtip/README.md) | [Deploy example to Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzOps%2Fmain%2Ftemplate%2Fux-foundation.json) |
| Enterprise-scale Virtual WAN | Add a Virtual WAN network module to the enterprise-scale foundation. | [Example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/master/docs/reference/contoso/Readme.md) | [Deploy example to Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzOps%2Fmain%2Ftemplate%2Fux-vwan.json) |
| Enterprise-scale hub and spoke | Add a hub and spoke network module to the enterprise-scale foundation. | [Example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/master/docs/reference/adventureworks/README.md) | <!-- [Deploy example to Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkrnese%2FAzureDeploy%2Fmaster%2FARM%2Fdeployments%2Fe2e.json) --> Coming soon |

## Next steps

The above examples provide an easy deployment option to support continued learning for the enterprise-scale approach. Before using these examples in a production version of enterprise-scale, you should first review the [enterprise-scale architecture](./architecture.md).
