# Scenario-specific enterprise-scale landing zones in Azure

Scenarios for enterprise-scale landing zones enable effective adoption and operationalization of key technologies on Azure. These specific scenarios can be used to accelerate adoption when your organization identifies business or technical requirements that require additional tier-1 technology platforms to support mission-critical workloads or business processes.

Scenarios for enterprise-scale landing zones provide specific, refined deployments which can be run on top of existing enterprise-scale landing zones.

Use the following information to prepare your landing zones for mission-critical technology platforms and any supported workloads.

## Scenarios

These landing zones have been developed in the broader context of common scenarios, such as:

| Scenario | Description | Landing zone |
|---|---|---|
|[Hybrid and multicloud](../../scenarios/hybrid/index.md)| Guidance on shaping an organizations approach to implementing a hybrid cloud strategy. | [Enterprise-scale for hybrid with Azure Arc](../../scenarios/hybrid/enterprise-scale-landing-zone.md)
|[SAP](../../scenarios/SAP/index.md)| Guidance for migrating or adopting SAP workloads as part of your cloud strategy. | [SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator](../../scenarios/sap/enterprise-scale-landing-zone.md) |
|[Virtual desktop](../../scenarios/wvd/index.md)| Guidance for migrating virtual desktops, or creating new as part of a cloud-focused productivity strategy. | [Enterprise-scale for Azure Virtual Desktop](../../scenarios/wvd/enterprise-scale-landing-zone.md) |
