# Subscription best practices

This article provides recommendations to help you plan and deploy your subscriptions. It helps organizations of all sizes and Azure maturity levels succeed in their cloud adoption journey. Subscriptions serve as fundamental units of management, billing, and scale within Azure, and proper design creates a foundation for secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud operations.

## Establish subscription policies

Subscriptions provide boundaries for governance, security, and cost management that must align with your business requirements and operational model. You must establish clear principles before creating subscriptions to avoid redesign as your environment grows. Here's how:

1. **Use management groups to govern subscriptions.** Management groups provide hierarchical organization and policy inheritance that simplifies governance at scale. Group related subscriptions together to apply consistent policies and access controls while maintaining flexibility for specific requirements within each group.

1. **Establish subscription creation and management processes.** Define clear processes for who can request new subscriptions, who approves them, and how they get created with proper configurations. Standardized processes ensure that all subscriptions meet your governance requirements while providing audit trails and accountability for subscription management activities.

1. **Use subscriptions as workload boundaries.** Each subscription should contain resources for a particular workload environment. This approach enables independent management of different business functions while maintaining security and compliance requirements. Workload-based boundaries simplify cost tracking, access control, and policy enforcement across your environment.

1. **Create separate subscriptions for different environments.** Production, non-production, and sandbox environments require different governance policies and access controls. Environmental separation prevents development activities from affecting production workloads while enabling appropriate flexibility for innovation and testing. This separation ensures that your production environment maintains the highest security and reliability standards.

### Create your initial subscriptions

1. **Start with three core subscriptions to establish proper boundaries.** Create one production subscription for live workloads, one non-production subscription for development and testing, and one sandbox subscription for experimentation and learning. This minimal structure provides essential separation while keeping management overhead low and costs predictable for small teams.

1. **Use Azure Dev/Test pricing to optimize costs in non-production environments.** [Azure Dev/Test offers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/dev-test/) provide significant cost savings for development, testing, and training activities. These pricing benefits help small organizations maximize their cloud investment while maintaining proper environment separation and governance practices.

## Govern your subscriptions

Effective subscription governance ensures your cloud resources remain secure, compliant, and cost-effective throughout their lifecycle. Governance controls protect your organization from security risks and unexpected costs while enabling teams to work efficiently. You need to establish appropriate controls that balance central oversight with workload-specific requirements. Here's how:

1. **Implement Azure Policy for consistent compliance across subscriptions.** Azure Policy provides automated enforcement of organizational standards and regulatory requirements. Create policy initiatives that apply baseline controls to all subscriptions while allowing appropriate customization for different workload types. This approach ensures all resources meet security and compliance requirements without restricting legitimate business activities.

2. **Delegate appropriate access controls to workload teams.** Role-based access control enables workload teams to manage their resources effectively while maintaining security boundaries. Assign built-in roles that provide the minimum permissions necessary for each team to perform their responsibilities. This delegation increases productivity and reduces bottlenecks while maintaining security through the principle of least privilege.

3. **Apply budgets and cost alerts to each subscription.** Azure Cost Management tools provide financial governance and prevent unexpected spending. Set appropriate budget thresholds with automated alerts at defined intervals (50%, 75%, 90%) to notify stakeholders before costs exceed limits. These controls help teams manage their cloud spending responsibly while providing visibility to financial stakeholders.

4. **Establish resource tagging standards for governance and cost allocation.** Consistent tagging enables accurate tracking and reporting across your environment. Define mandatory tags for ownership, cost center, environment, and application to support governance reporting and chargeback processes. This standardization improves visibility and accountability for all resources across your subscriptions.

## Scale your subscriptions

As your cloud environment grows, your subscription creation process must evolve to support increasing workloads, teams, and complexity. Effective scaling requires clear processes, standardization, and automation to maintain governance while enabling business agility. You need to establish scalable patterns that support growth without compromising security or management. Here's how:

1. **Define clear roles and workflows for subscription creation and approval.** Organizational responsibilities establish accountability for the subscription lifecycle process. Standardized workflows prevent unauthorized subscription creation, reduce management complexity, and ensure alignment with organizational standards and workload boundaries.

1. **Use subscription templates with predefined configurations.** Templates provide consistency across your growing environment. These standardized configurations include policies, role assignments, tags, and baseline resources tailored to specific subscription types. Templates reduce configuration effort and enforce security and governance requirements from the start.

1. **Automate subscription management and provisioning processes.** Automation tools eliminate manual errors and ensure compliance at scale. These tools streamline subscription creation, configuration, and governance while accelerating response to business needs. For more information, see [subscription vending](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending).

1. **Monitor subscription quotas and limits proactively.** Regular monitoring prevents unexpected service disruptions. Track resource usage against Azure subscription limits to identify when additional subscriptions are needed before reaching critical thresholds. For details, see [Azure subscription limits and quotas](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#general-limits).

1. **Optimize cross-subscription networking costs in your architecture.** Efficient network design balances isolation with cost management. Minimize unnecessary data transfers between subscriptions while maintaining workload isolation and shared service access. This approach ensures cost efficiency without compromising your operational requirements.

## Monitor and optimize your subscription design

Continuous monitoring and optimization ensure that your subscription design continues to meet business requirements and provides value over time. Regular evaluation helps identify opportunities for improvement and prevents small issues from becoming significant problems. You must establish monitoring and review processes that scale with your environment and provide actionable insights. Here's how:

1. **Conduct regular subscription reviews.** Schedule quarterly or yearly reviews of your subscription structure to ensure it continues to align with business requirements and best practices. Regular reviews help identify consolidation opportunities, eliminate unused subscriptions, and optimize your overall Azure architecture for current and future needs.

1. **Plan for subscription lifecycle management.** Establish processes for decommissioning unused subscriptions, transferring resources between subscriptions when requirements change, and maintaining compliance throughout the subscription lifecycle. Proper lifecycle management prevents subscription sprawl and ensures that your environment remains organized and cost-effective over time.
