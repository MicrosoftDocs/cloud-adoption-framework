# Governance, security, and compliance in Azure

As you establish corporate policy and plan your governance strategies, you can use tools and services like Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud to enforce and automate your organization's governance decisions. Before you start your governance planning, use the [governance benchmark tool](https://cafbaseline.com) to identify potential gaps in your organization's cloud governance approach. For more information about developing governance processes, see the [Govern methodology](../../govern/index.md).

## [Azure Blueprints](#tab/AzureBlueprints)

Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprints makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and create new environments and trust that they're building within organizational compliance using a set of built-in components like networking to speed up development and delivery.

Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts like:

- Role assignments.
- Policy assignments.
- Azure Resource Manager templates.
- Resource groups.

### Create a blueprint

To create a blueprint:

::: zone target="chromeless"

1. Go to **Blueprints: Getting started**.
1. In the **Create a Blueprint** section, select **Create**.
1. Filter the list of blueprints to select the appropriate blueprint.
1. Enter the **Blueprint name**, then select the appropriate **Definition location**.
1. Select **Next : Artifacts**, then review the artifacts included in the blueprint.
1. Select **Save Draft**.

::: form action="OpenBlade[#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/GetStarted]" submitText="Create a blueprint" :::

::: zone-end

::: zone target="docs"

1. In the Azure portal, go to [Blueprints: Get started](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/GetStarted).
1. In the **Create a Blueprint** section, select **Create**.
1. Filter the list of blueprints to select the appropriate blueprint.
1. Enter the **Blueprint name**, then select the appropriate **Definition location**.
1. Select **Next : Artifacts**, then review the artifacts included in the blueprint.
1. Select **Save Draft**.

::: zone-end

### Publish a blueprint

To publish blueprint artifacts to your subscription:

::: zone target="chromeless"

1. Go to **Blueprints: Blueprint definitions**.
1. Select the blueprint you created in the previous steps.
1. Review the blueprint definition, then select **Publish blueprint**.
1. Provide a **Version** (such as `1.0`) and any **Change notes**, then select **Publish**.

::: form action="OpenBlade[#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/Blueprints]" submitText="Blueprint definitions" :::

::: zone-end

::: zone target="docs"

1. In the Azure portal, go to [Blueprints: Blueprint definitions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/Blueprints).
1. Select the blueprint definition you created in the previous steps.
1. Review the blueprint definition, then select **Publish blueprint**.
1. Provide a **Version** (such as `1.0`) and any **Change notes**, then select **Publish**.

## [Azure Policy](#tab/AzurePolicy)

Azure Policy is a service that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce rules on your resources so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service-level agreements. Azure Policy scans your resources to identify resources that aren't compliant with the policies you implement. For example, you can have a policy to allow only a specific virtual machine (VM) size to run in your environment. When you implement this policy, it evaluates existing VMs in your environment and any new VMs that are deployed. The policy evaluation generates compliance events for you to use for monitoring and reporting.

Consider common policies to:

- Enforce tagging for resources and resource groups.
- Restrict regions for deployed resources.
- Restrict expensive SKUs for specific resources.
- Audit use of important optional features like Azure-managed disks.

::: zone target="chromeless"

### Action

Assign a built-in policy to a management group, subscription, or resource group.

::: form action="OpenBlade[#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/GettingStarted]" submitText="Assign Policy" :::

::: zone-end

::: zone target="docs"

### Apply a policy

To apply a policy to a resource group:

1. Go to [Azure Policy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/GettingStarted).
1. Select **Assign a policy**.

## [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](#tab/AzureSecurityCenter)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud plays an important part in your governance strategy. It helps you stay on top of security because it:

- Provides a unified view of security across your workloads.
- Collects, searches, and analyzes security data from a variety of sources, which includes firewalls and other partner solutions.
- Provides actionable security recommendations to fix issues before they can be exploited.
- Can be used to apply security policies across your hybrid cloud workloads to ensure compliance with security standards.

Many security features, like security policy and recommendations, are available for free. Some of the more advanced features, like just-in-time VM access and hybrid workload support, are available under the Defender for Cloud Standard tier. Just-in-time VM access can help reduce the network attack surface by controlling access to management ports on Azure VMs.

> [!TIP]
> Defender for Cloud is enabled by default in each subscription. We recommend that you enable data collection from virtual machines to allow Defender for Cloud to install its agent and begin gathering data.

::: zone target="docs"

To explore Defender for Cloud, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/SecurityMenuBlade/0).
