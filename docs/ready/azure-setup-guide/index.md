# Azure setup guide overview

Before you start building and deploying solutions by using Azure services, you need to prepare your environment. In this guide, we introduce features that help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization. For more information, best practices, and considerations related to preparing your cloud environment, see the [Cloud Adoption Framework's readiness section](../index.md).

| Azure setup guide step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Organize resources](./organize-resources.md) | Set up a management hierarchy to consistently apply access control, policy, and compliance to groups of resources and use tagging to track related resources. |
| [Select regions](./regions.md) | Choose Azure regions based on compliance, proximity, reliability, and scalability. |
| [Manage access](./manage-access.md) | Use Azure role-based access control to make sure that users only have the permissions they need. |
| [Manage costs and billing](./manage-costs.md) | Identify your subscription type, understand how billing works, and learn how to control costs. |
| [Plan for governance, security, and compliance](./govern-org-compliance.md) | Enforce and automate policies and security settings that help you follow applicable legal requirements. |
| [Use monitoring and reporting](./monitoring-reporting.md) | Get visibility across resources to find and fix problems, optimize performance, and gain insight into customer behavior. |
