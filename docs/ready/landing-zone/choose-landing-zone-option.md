# Choose the landing zone for your organization

There are different approaches to implementing a landing zone or landing zones in the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). The right approach for your organization has the necessary services to support your business applications without extra overhead to manage. Starting with an implementation that doesn't meet your needs can waste your time and effort.

Microsoft offers two implementation options for landing zones:

- Start small and expand
- Enterprise scale

You might also consider third-party implementations. Our partners have many implementations available through their services. For more information, see [Evaluate a Microsoft partner's Azure landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/partner-landing-zone).

## Overview of landing zone options

The following table summarizes considerations for the different options.

## Initial considerations

Which operating model better describes your organization?

- Centralized operations. In this small environment, centralized teams for ITOps, IT security, or other roles manage production and workloads.
- Enterprise operations. Usually a larger environment with stable, steady state, which are managed centrally.

Centralized operations favor a start small and expand approach. Enterprise operations might be better addressed with enterprise scale.

Be aware not just of what your organization looks like now, but what you expect and want it to be in three months to a year, or perhaps farther out.

For more information about operations types, see [Compare common cloud operating models](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model/compare).

Do you need a baseline architecture or environment?

The start small and expand approach offers a simple starting point where you can build your own solution. The enterprise-scale approach provides an environment for the entire Azure tenant, which includes cloud-native operations.

## Adoption plan considerations

The following considerations are key to your adoption plan for either type:

- Long term self-sufficiency
- Adoption velocity across the organization
- Operational excellence

Enterprise scale provides long term self-sufficiency and operational excellence immediately. Enterprise scale also facilitates fast, compliant adoption across your organization. The enterprise scale approach builds out a foundation for you, including all the guardrails around security, identity, network, even DevOps and automation.

If you start small and expand, there are ways to get to self-sufficiency, adoption velocity, and operational excellence. Use the governance or the management methodologies inside the Cloud Adoption Framework to iteratively build those pieces into the landing zone solution. Use the eight areas of design [Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale design guidelines](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/design-guidelines) to iteratively improve your design.

To learn more about operational excellence, see [Deliver operational excellence during digital transformation](/../../get-started/operational-excellence).

## Compliance considerations

Consider the following issues around compliance for your organization:

- Path to reach security, governance, and compliance
- Risks while building out security, governance, and compliance

Your organization might need to have a particular workload or application that needs to be compliant in a short amount of time. This may affect your choice.

The start small and expand approach uses an iterative approach to compliance. Use Govern and Manage methodologies to support sensitive data or mission critical workloads. For more information, see [Govern methodology for the cloud](../../govern/methodology) and [IT management and operations in the cloud](../../manage/considerations/index).

The enterprise-scale architecture includes designs for segmentation and separation to support compliance goals.

If possible, identify low-risk workloads to implement first. This technique helps you build infrastructure and skills over time. You can add the governance and management methodologies as you understand how the cloud works.

## Deployment considerations

Deploying your landing zone or landing zones raises several considerations for choosing an implementation:

- Best practices from cloud provider
- All critical services are present and properly configured according to recommended best practices for identity/access management, governance, security, network, and logging
- Automation capabilities, such as Infrastructure as Code and Azure DevOps

Both implementation offer best practices. Start small and expand lets you add best practices using CAF methodologies to apply security, governance, and compliance.

Enterprise scale comes with all critical services configured. Start small and expand comes with some resources deployed.

For more information about best practices, see [Best practices for Azure readiness](../azure-best-practices/index).

Both methodologies offer automation capabilities.

- Start small and expand: ARM, Policy, Blueprint. Can create your own CI/CD pipeline.
- Enterprise scale: ARM, Policy, GitHub/AzureDevOps, CI/CD pipeline option included.

Start small and expand uses Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, and ARM templates. Enterprise scale offers several different deployments.

Whether you implement start small and expand or enterprise scale, you can use templates and a portal-based experience. You can include infrastructure as code later in the process. For more information, see [Infrastructure as code](/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/infrastructure-as-code).

## Timeline considerations

Landing zone options take different amounts of time to implement. There are two kinds of timelines:

- Timeline to adopt or migrate a low risk workload
- Timelines to reach security, governance, and compliance requirements for all workloads

With a start small and expand approach, you can have a low-risk workload up and running in three to ten days. For workloads with high security, governance, and compliance requirements, it could take four to six months.

For an enterprise-scale implementation, you can still adopt a low risk workload in three to ten days, but more elaborate workloads can be ready in six to eight weeks.
