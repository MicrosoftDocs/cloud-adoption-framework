# Azure landing zones canary approach with multiple tenants

When you have multiple Azure Active Directory tenants, you can handle Azure landing zones canary environments the same way you handle them within a single Azure Active Directory tenant. If you're a multi-tenant ALZ consumer, follow the [canary guidance](../../../enterprise-scale/testing-approach.md) in each Azure Active Directory tenant separately.

## Deployment stamps approach

If you're a customer that's following a [deployment stamps pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/deployment-stamp) for each of your Azure Active Directory tenants ALZ deployments (for example, each of the ALZ deployments is the same in structure, apart from a few naming changes), you might only need to have a single canary deployment because all your ALZ deployments are the same.

>[!NOTE]
> This approach is common in a Managed Service Provider (MSP) environment where the MSP manages several Azure Active Directory tenants for different clients that are all similar, except for their naming.

>[!TIP]
> Customers that follow the deployment stamp style pattern might also benefit from following the [Automation approach 2 â€“ Shared application registration (multi-tenant) with multiple service principals](automation.md#approach-2--shared-application-registration-multi-tenant-with-multiple-service-principals).
