# What is an Azure landing zone?

Azure landing zones are the output of a multisubscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security, governance, networking, and identity. Azure landing zones enable application migrations and greenfield development at an enterprise scale in Azure. These zones consider all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio and don't differentiate between infrastructure as a service or platform as a service.

## Scalable and modular

No single solution fits all technical environments. A few Azure landing zone implementation options can help you meet the deployment and operations needs of your growing cloud portfolio. All Azure landing zones provide a scalable, modular approach to building out your environment based on a common set of design areas. Whether you're looking to deploy your first production application to Azure or you're operating a complex portfolio of workloads, the Azure landing zone implementation options can be tailored to your needs.

## Next steps

When you're choosing the right Azure landing zone implementation option, you should understand the [Azure landing zone design areas](./design-areas.md).
