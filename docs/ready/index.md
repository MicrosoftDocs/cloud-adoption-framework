# Ensure the environment is prepared for the cloud adoption plan

Before adoption can begin, you must create a landing zone to host the workloads that you plan to build in or migrate to the cloud . This section of the framework guides you through how a landing zone is created.

The following exercises help guide you through the process of creating a landing zone to support cloud adoption.
