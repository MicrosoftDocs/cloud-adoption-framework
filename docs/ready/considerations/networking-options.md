# Review your network options

Designing and implementing Azure networking capabilities is a critical part of your cloud adoption efforts. You'll need to make networking design decisions to properly support the workloads and services that will be hosted in the cloud. Azure networking products and services support a wide variety of networking capabilities. How you structure these services and the networking architectures you choose depends on your organization's workload, governance, and connectivity requirements.

## Identify workload networking requirements

As part of your landing zone evaluation and preparation, you need to identify the networking capabilities that your landing zone needs to support. This process involves assessing each of the applications and services that make up your workloads to determine their connectivity network control requirements. After you identify and document the requirements, you can create policies for your landing zone to control the allowed networking resources and configuration based on your workload needs.

For each application or service you'll deploy to your landing zone environment, use the following decision tree as a starting point to help you determine the networking tools or services to use:

### Key questions

Answer the following questions about your workloads to help you make decisions based on the Azure networking services decision tree:

- **Will your workloads require a virtual network?** Managed platform as a service (PaaS) resource types use underlying platform network capabilities that don't always require a virtual network. If your workloads don't require advanced networking features and you don't need to deploy infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources, the default [native networking capabilities provided by PaaS resources](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/paas-only.md) might meet your workload connectivity and traffic management requirements.
- **Will your workloads require connectivity between virtual networks and your on-premises datacenter?** Azure provides two solutions for establishing hybrid networking capabilities: Azure VPN gateway and Azure ExpressRoute. [Azure VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) connects your on-premises networks to Azure through site-to-site VPNs similar to how you might set up and connect to a remote branch office. VPN gateway has a maximum bandwidth of 10 Gbps. [Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) offers higher reliability and lower latency by using a private connection between Azure and your on-premises infrastructure. Bandwidth options for ExpressRoute range from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps.
- **Will you need to inspect and audit outgoing traffic by using on-premises network devices?** For cloud-native workloads, you can use [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) or cloud-hosted, third-party [network virtual appliances (NVAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/network-appliances) to inspect and audit traffic moving to or from the public internet. But many enterprise IT security policies require internet-bound outgoing traffic to pass through centrally managed devices in the organization's on-premises environment. [Forced tunneling](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) supports these scenarios. Not all managed services support forced tunneling. Services and features like [App Service Environment in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/environment/intro), [Azure API management](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts), [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes), [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-index), [Azure Databricks](/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks), and [Azure HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight) support this configuration when the service or feature is deployed inside a virtual network.
- **Do you need to connect multiple virtual networks?** You can use [virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) to connect multiple instances of [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview). Peering can support connections across subscriptions and regions. For scenarios where you provide services that are shared across multiple subscriptions or need to manage a large number of network peerings, consider adopting a [hub and spoke networking architecture](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/hub-spoke.md) or using [Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about). Virtual network peering provides connectivity only between two peered networks. By default, it doesn't provide transitive connectivity across multiple peerings.
- **Will your workloads be accessible over the internet?** Azure provides services that are designed to help you manage and secure external access to your applications and services:
  - [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview)
  - [Network appliances](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/network-appliances)
  - [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)
  - [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway)
  - [Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)
- **Will you need to support custom DNS management?** [Azure DNS](/azure/dns/dns-overview) is a hosting service for DNS domains. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. If your workloads require name resolution that goes beyond the features that are provided by Azure DNS, you might need to deploy additional solutions. If your workloads also require Active Directory services, consider using [Azure Active Directory Domain Services](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/overview) to augment Azure DNS capabilities. For more capabilities, you can also [deploy custom IaaS virtual machines](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances) to support your requirements.

## Common networking scenarios

Azure networking is composed of multiple products and services that provide different networking capabilities. As part of your networking design process, you can compare your workload requirements to the networking scenarios in the following table to identify the Azure tools or services you can use to provide these networking capabilities:

| I want to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network-scenario level. | [Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher) |
| I need native firewall capabilities, with built-in high availability, unrestricted cloud scalability, and zero maintenance. | [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) |
| I need to connect business offices, retail locations, and sites securely. | [Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan) |

## Choose a networking architecture

After you identify the Azure networking services that you need to support your workloads, you also need to design the architecture that will combine these services to provide your landing zone's cloud networking infrastructure. The Cloud Adoption Framework [Software Defined Networking decision guide](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/index.md) provides details about some of the most common networking architecture patterns used on Azure.

The following table summarizes the primary scenarios that these patterns support:

| Scenario  | Suggested network architecture                                                  |
| --- | --- |
| All of the Azure-hosted workloads deployed to your landing zone will be entirely PaaS-based, won't require a virtual network, and aren't part of a wider cloud adoption effort that includes IaaS resources.                                                                                                                                                          | [PaaS-only](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/paas-only.md)            |
| Your Azure-hosted workloads will deploy IaaS-based resources like virtual machines or otherwise require a virtual network, but don't require connectivity to your on-premises environment.                                                                                                                                                                            | [Cloud-native](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/cloud-native.md)      |
| Your Azure-hosted workloads require limited access to on-premises resources, but you're required to treat cloud connections as untrusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Cloud DMZ](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/cloud-dmz.md)            |
| Your Azure-hosted workloads require limited access to on-premises resources, and you plan to implement mature security policies and secure connectivity between the cloud and your on-premises environment.                                                                                                                                                           | [Hybrid](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/hybrid.md)                  |
| You need to deploy and manage a large number of VMs and workloads, potentially exceeding [Azure subscription limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits), you need to share services across subscriptions, or you need a more segmented structure for role, application, or permission segregation. | [Hub and spoke](../../decision-guides/software-defined-network/hub-spoke.md)        |
| You have many branch offices that need to connect to each other and to Azure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about) |

### Azure Virtual Datacenter

In addition using one of these architecture patterns, if your enterprise IT group manages large cloud environments, consider consulting the [CAF enterprise-scale landing zone](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md). When you design your Azure-based cloud infrastructure, the CAF enterprise-scale landing zone provides a combined approach to networking, security, management, and infrastructure if you have a mid-term objective (within 24 months) to **host more than 1,000 assets (apps, infrastructure, or data assets) in the cloud**.

For organizations that meet the following criteria, you may also want to start with the [CAF enterprise-scale landing zone](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md):

- Your enterprise is subject to regulatory compliance requirements that require centralized monitoring and audit capabilities.
- You need to maintain common policy and governance compliance and centralized IT control over core services.
- Your industry depends on a complex platform which requires complex controls and deep domain expertise to govern the platform. This is most common in large enterprises within finance, oil and gas, or manufacturing.
- Your existing IT governance policies require tighter parity with existing features, even during early stage adoption.
