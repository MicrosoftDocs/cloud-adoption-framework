# Improve landing zone governance

As your cloud environment evolves over time, you need to evolve your cloud governance policies and processes that apply to your landing zones. For more information on cloud governance, see the [Govern methodology](../../govern/index.md).

## Landing zone governance best practices

The following best practices provide examples of ways to improve landing zone governance:

- [Define a naming convention](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming) and [tagging strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging): Ensure consistency in naming and tagging, which is the foundational data for establishing sound governance practices.

- [Track costs across workloads](../azure-best-practices/track-costs.md): Begin tracking costs in your first landing zone. Evaluate how you track costs across multiple workloads and roles.

- [Scale with multiple subscriptions](../azure-best-practices/scale-subscriptions.md): Evaluate how this landing zone and other landing zones scale as you add more subscriptions.

- [Organize subscriptions](../landing-zone/design-area/resource-org.md): Understand how to organize and manage multiple subscriptions.

- [Keep your Azure landing zone up to date](../../govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date.md): Why you should update your Azure landing zone environment, and how to get more information.

## Next steps

The cloud environment expands with each new workload you add. To stay ahead of these requirements, cloud platform teams should periodically review the landing zone design areas.
