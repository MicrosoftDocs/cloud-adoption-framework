# Cloud management overview

The Cloud Adoption Framework's (CAF) Manage methodology offers a structured approach to cloud operations in Azure. Cloud operations include maintaining, managing, and optimizing your cloud environment. 

Organizations of any size or industry can apply this methodology. The CAF Manage methodology helps you address critical aspects of cloud operations, ensuring the health and performance of your entire cloud environment.

## Why is cloud management important?

Effective cloud management maintains business continuity while controlling costs in your Azure environment. Proper management reduces downtime, strengthens security, simplifies change management, and speeds incident response.
