# Skills readiness for cloud monitoring

This article is part of a series in [the cloud monitoring guide](./index.md).

Planning for cloud monitoring requires understanding how you'll operate your workloads before releasing them into production and continuous monitoring in a live production environment.

Business stakeholders expect services to run without disruption. Organizations often realize that their IT staff need to learn new skills and adapt to the ever-changing landscape in the cloud. Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with several learning paths, as you see listed in this article.

Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths. They're organized starting with learning the fundamentals and then divided across three primary subject domains: infrastructure, application, and data analysis.

## Fundamentals

- Introduction to [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) discusses the basic concepts of management and deployment of Azure resources. The IT staff managing the monitoring experience across the enterprise should understand management scopes, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and managing resources using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.

- Introduction to [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) helps you learn how to use Azure Policy to create, assign, and manage policies. Azure Policy can deploy and configure the Azure Monitor agents, enable monitoring with Azure VM insights and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, deploy diagnostic settings, audit guest configuration settings, and more.

- Introduction to [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), our cross-platform command-line experience for managing Azure resources. Also, review the introduction to [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps). Extend your skills with the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell further by taking these Microsoft Learn courses:

- With [Azure Arc for servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview), learn how you can manage your Windows and Linux machines hosted outside of Azure similarly to how you manage virtual machines running in Azure.

- Read the [overview of VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview) to learn how to monitor the performance and health of your virtual machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

## Application monitoring

- Understand how [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) helps you view the availability and performance of your applications and services together from one place. The following courses can help:

- The Microsoft Learn module [Monitor the health and performance of your web apps](/training/modules/monitor-health-performance-of-your-web-applications/) teaches you how to monitor your solution for performance and issues using Application Insights.

- Learn to [Instrument server-side web application code with Application Insights](/training/modules/instrument-web-app-code-with-application-insights/) with Microsoft Learn.

- [Capture and view page load times in your Azure web app](/training/modules/capture-page-load-times-application-insights/). Get started with this course on using Azure Monitor Application Insights for end-to-end monitoring of your application's components running in Azure.

- [`Microsoft Azure Database Monitoring Playbook`](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-azure-database-playbook-monitoring) helps you learn how to implement and use the monitoring of Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and Azure Cosmos DB.

### Azure DevOps and project management

IT teams responsible for monitoring the enterprise need to include agile training and participation in DevOps activities. This also includes following the *Dev* in DevOps by turning requirements into organized agile requirements to deliver minimally viable monitoring solutions refined iteratively and in line with business needs.

To learn more, review the following:

- [Get started with Azure DevOps](/training/modules/get-started-with-devops/).

- [Introduce DevOps Dojo: Create efficiencies that support your business](/training/paths/devops-dojo-white-belt-foundation/).

- [Evolve your DevOps practices](/training/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/).

- [Automate your deployments with Azure DevOps](/training/modules/deploy-nodejs/).

### Other considerations

Customers often need help managing, maintaining, and delivering the expected business outcomes for IT services. Monitoring is considered core to managing infrastructure and the business, focusing on measuring service quality and customer experience.

To achieve those goals, lay the groundwork using IT Service Management (ITSM) with DevOps, which will help the monitoring team mature how they manage, deliver, and support the monitoring service. Adopting an ITSM framework allows the monitoring team to function as a provider and gain recognition as a trusted business enabler by aligning with the strategic goals and needs of the organization.

Consider the [IT4IT reference architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/it4it) that uses a process-agnostic framework to deliver an alternative standard for transforming IT.
