# Skills readiness for cloud monitoring

When planning your migration journey, the objective is to develop the plans necessary to guide implementation. The plans need to also include how you will operate these workloads before they are transitioned or released into production, and not afterwards. Business stakeholders expect valuable services, and they expect them without disruption. IT staff members realize they need to learn new skills and adapt so they are prepared to confidently use the integrated Azure services to effectively monitor resources in Azure and hybrid environments.

Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths. They are organized starting with learning the fundamentals and then divided across three primary subject domains: infrastructure, application, and data analysis.

## Fundamentals

- Introduction to [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) discusses the basic concepts of management and deployment of Azure resources. The IT staff managing the monitoring experience across the enterprise should understand management scopes, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), using. Azure Resource Manager templates, and management of resources using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.

- Introduction to [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) helps you learn how you can use Azure Policy to create, assign, and manage policies. Azure Policy can deploy and configure the Azure Monitor agents, enable monitoring with Azure Monitor for VMs and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, deploy diagnostic settings, audit guest configuration settings, and more.

- Introduction to [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), which is our cross-platform command-line experience for managing Azure resources.

## Azure DevOps and project management

The hybrid cloud environment disrupts IT with undefined roles, responsibilities, and activities. Organizations must move to modern practices to manage services, including agile and DevOps methodologies, to better meet the transformation and optimization needs of today's businesses in a streamlined and efficient manner.

As part of migrating to a cloud monitoring platform, the IT team responsible for managing monitoring in the enterprise needs to include agile training and participation in DevOps activities. This also includes following the *Dev* in DevOps by taking requirements and turning into organized agile requirements, in order to deliver minimally viable monitoring solutions that are refined iteratively and in line with business needs. For source control to manage the iterative monitoring solution packages and any other related collateral, connect your Azure DevOps Server project with a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. This provides a link from commits and pull requests in GitHub to work items. You can use GitHub Enterprise for development in support of continuous monitoring integration and deployment, while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work.

## Other considerations

Customers often struggle to manage, maintain, and deliver the expected business (and to the IT organization) outcomes for the services that IT is charged with delivering. Monitoring is considered core to managing infrastructure and the business, with a focus on measuring quality of service and customer experience. In order to achieve those goals, lay the groundwork using ITSM in conjunction with DevOps, which will help the monitoring team mature how they manage, deliver, and support the monitoring service. Adopting an ITSM framework allows the monitoring team to function as a provider and gain recognition as a trusted business enabler by aligning to the strategic goals and needs of the organization.

Review the following to understand the updates made to the most popular ITSM framework [`ITIL 4 and the Cloud` white paper](https://www.axelos.com/case-studies-and-white-papers/itil-4-and-the-cloud), which focuses on joining existing ITIL guidance with best practices from DevOps, agile, and lean approaches. Also consider the [IT4IT reference architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/it4it) that delivers an alternative blueprint on how to transform IT using a process agnostic framework.
