# Skills readiness for cloud monitoring

The objective of planning your migration journey is to develop the plans necessary to guide implementation. The plans also need to include how you'll operate these workloads before they're transitioned or released into production, as opposed to afterward. Business stakeholders expect valuable services, and they expect them without disruption. IT staff members realize they need to learn new skills and adapt. Hence, they're prepared to confidently use the integrated Azure services to monitor resources effectively in Azure and hybrid environments.

Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths. They're organized starting with learning the fundamentals and then divided across three primary subject domains: infrastructure, application, and data analysis.

## Fundamentals

- Introduction to [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) discusses the basic concepts of management and deployment of Azure resources. The IT staff managing the monitoring experience across the enterprise should understand management scopes, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and managing resources using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.

- Introduction to [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) helps you learn how to use Azure Policy to create, assign, and manage policies. Azure Policy can deploy and configure the Azure Monitor agents, enable monitoring with Azure VM insights and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, deploy diagnostic settings, audit guest configuration settings, and more.

- Introduction to [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), our cross-platform command-line experience for managing Azure resources. Also, review the introduction to [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps). Extend your skills with the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell further by taking these Microsoft Learn courses:

- With [Azure Arc for servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview), learn how you can manage your Windows and Linux machines hosted outside of Azure similarly to how you manage virtual machines running in Azure.

- Read the [overview of VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview) to learn how to monitor the performance and health of your virtual machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

## Application monitoring

- Understand how [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) helps you view the availability and performance of your applications and services together from one place. The following courses can help:

- The Microsoft Learn module [Monitor the health and performance of your web apps](/training/modules/monitor-health-performance-of-your-web-applications/) teaches you how to monitor your solution for performance and issues using Application Insights.

- Learn to [Instrument server-side web application code with Application Insights](/training/modules/instrument-web-app-code-with-application-insights/) with Microsoft Learn.

## Azure DevOps and project management

The hybrid cloud environment disrupts IT with undefined roles, responsibilities, and activities. Organizations must move to modern practices to manage services, including agile and DevOps methodologies, to better meet the transformation and optimization needs of today's businesses in a streamlined and efficient manner.

As part of migrating to a cloud monitoring platform, the IT team responsible for monitoring the enterprise needs to include agile training and participation in DevOps activities. This also includes following the *Dev* in DevOps by taking requirements and turning them into organized agile requirements to deliver minimally viable monitoring solutions refined iteratively and in line with business needs. Connect your Azure DevOps Server project with a GitHub Enterprise Server repository for source control to manage the iterative monitoring solution packages and any other related collateral. This links commits and pull requests in GitHub to work items. You can use GitHub Enterprise for development to support continuous monitoring integration and deployment while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work.

## Other considerations

Customers often need help with managing, maintaining, and delivering the expected business (and to the IT organization) outcomes for the services that IT provides. Monitoring is considered core to managing infrastructure and the business, focusing on measuring service quality and customer experience. To achieve those goals, lay the groundwork using ITSM in conjunction with DevOps, which will help the monitoring team mature how they manage, deliver, and support the monitoring service. Adopting an ITSM framework allows the monitoring team to function as a provider and gain recognition as a trusted business enabler by aligning with the strategic goals and needs of the organization.

Review the following to understand the updates made to the most popular ITSM framework [`ITIL 4 and the Cloud` white paper](https://www.axelos.com/case-studies-and-white-papers/itil-4-and-the-cloud), which focuses on joining existing ITIL guidance with best practices from DevOps, agile and lean approaches. Also, consider the [IT4IT reference architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/it4it) that delivers an alternative blueprint for transforming IT using a process-agnostic framework.
