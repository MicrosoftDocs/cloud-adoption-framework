# Cloud monitoring guide: Monitoring strategy for cloud deployment models

This article includes our recommended monitoring strategy for each of the cloud deployment models, based on the following criteria:

- You must maintain your commitment to Operations Manager or another enterprise monitoring platform, because it's integrated with your IT operations processes, knowledge, and expertise, or certain functionality isn't available yet in Azure Monitor.
- You must monitor workloads both on-premises and in the public cloud, or just in the cloud.
- Your cloud migration strategy includes modernizing IT operations and moving to our cloud monitoring services and solutions.
- You might have critical systems that are air-gapped or physically isolated, or are hosted in a private cloud or on physical hardware, and these systems need to be monitored.

Our strategy includes support for monitoring infrastructure (compute, storage, and server workloads), application (end-user, exceptions, and client), and network resources. It delivers a complete, service-oriented monitoring perspective.

## Azure cloud monitoring

Azure Monitor is the Azure native platform service that provides a single source for monitoring Azure resources. It's designed for cloud solutions that:

- Are built on Azure.
- Support a business capability thatâ€™s based on virtual machine (VM) workloads or complex architectures that use microservices and other platform resources.

It monitors all layers of the stack, starting with tenant services, such as Azure Active Directory Domain Services, and subscription-level events and Azure service health.

It also monitors infrastructure resources, such as VMs, storage, and network resources. At the top layer, it monitors your application.

By monitoring each of these dependencies, and collecting the right signals that each can emit, you get the observability of applications and the key infrastructure you need.

Our recommended approach to monitoring each layer of the stack is summarized in the following table:

Layer | Resource | Scope | Method
---|---|---|----
Application | A web-based application that runs on .NET, .NET Core, Java, JavaScript, and Node.js platform on an Azure VM, Azure App Services, Azure Service Fabric, Azure Functions, and Azure Cloud Services. | Monitor a live web application to automatically detect performance anomalies, identify code exceptions and issues, and collect user behavior analytics. |  Azure Monitor (Application Insights).

## Hybrid cloud monitoring

For many organizations, transition to the cloud must be approached gradually, where the hybrid cloud model is the most common first step in the journey. You carefully select the appropriate subset of applications and infrastructure to begin your migration, while you avoid disruption to your business. However, because we offer two monitoring platforms that support this cloud model, IT decision makers might be uncertain as to which is the best choice to support their business and IT operational goals.

In this section, we address the uncertainty by reviewing several factors and offering an understanding of which platform to consider.

Keep in mind the following key technical aspects:

- You need to collect data from Azure resources that support the workload, and forward them to your existing on-premises or managed service provider tools.

- You need to maintain your current investment in System Center Operations Manager, and configure it to monitor IaaS and PaaS resources that are running in Azure. Optionally, because you're monitoring two environments with different characteristics, based on your requirements, you need to determine how integrating with Azure Monitor supports your strategy.

- As part of your modernization strategy to standardize on a single tool to reduce cost and complexity, you need to commit to Azure Monitor for monitoring the resources in Azure and on your corporate network.

The following table summarizes the requirements that Azure Monitor and System Center Operations Manager support with monitoring the hybrid cloud model based on a common set of criteria.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

|Requirement | Azure Monitor | Operations Manager |
|:--|:---|:---|
|Infrastructure requirements | No | Yes<br> Requires, at a minimum, a management server and a SQL server to host the operational database and the reporting data warehouse database.

### Collect and stream monitoring data to third-party or on-premises tools

To collect metrics and logs from Azure infrastructure and platform resources, you need to enable Azure Diagnostics logs for those resources. Additionally, with Azure VMs, you can collect metrics and logs from the guest OS by enabling the Azure Diagnostics extension. To forward the diagnostics data that's emitted from your Azure resources to your on-premises tools or managed service provider, configure [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-stream-event-hubs) to stream the data to them.

### Monitor with System Center Operations Manager

Although System Center Operations Manager was originally designed as an on-premises solution to monitor across applications, workloads, and infrastructure components that are running in your IT environment, it evolved to include cloud-monitoring capabilities. It integrates with Azure, Office 365, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It can monitor across these diverse environments with management packs that are designed and updated to support them.  

For customers who have made significant investments in Operations Manager to achieve comprehensive monitoring that's tightly integrated with their IT service management processes and tools, or for customers new to Azure, it's understandable to ask the following questions:

- Can Operations Manager continue to deliver value, and does it make business sense?
- Do the features in Operations Manager make it the right fit for our IT organization?
- Does integrating Operations Manager with Azure Monitor provide the cost-effective and comprehensive monitoring solution that we require?

If you've already invested in Operations Manager, you don't need to focus on planning a migration to replace it immediately. With Azure or other cloud providers that exist as an extension of your own on-premises network, Operations Manager can monitor the guest VMs and Azure resources as if they were on your corporate network. This approach requires a reliable network connection between your network and the Azure virtual network that has sufficient bandwidth.

To monitor the workloads that are running in Azure, you need:

- The [Management Pack for Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50013). It collects performance metrics emitted by Azure services such as web and worker roles, Application Insights availability tests (web tests), Azure Service Bus, and so on. The management pack uses the Azure REST API to monitor the availability and performance of these resources. Some Azure service types have no metrics or predefined monitors in the Management Pack, but you can still monitor them through the relationships defined in the Azure Management Pack for discovered services.

- The [Management Pack for Azure SQL Database](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=38829) to monitor the availability and performance of Azure SQL databases and Azure SQL database servers using the Azure REST API and T-SQL queries to SQL Server system views.

- To monitor the guest OS and workloads that are running on the VM, such as SQL Server, IIS, or Apache Tomcat, you need to download and import the management pack that supports the application, service, and OS.

Knowledge is defined in the management pack, which describes how to monitor the individual dependencies and components. Both Azure management packs require performing a set of configuration steps in Azure and Operations Manager before you can begin monitoring these resources.

At the application tier, Operations Manager offers basic application performance monitoring capabilities for some legacy versions of .NET and Java. If certain applications within your hybrid cloud environment operate in an offline or network-isolated mode, such that they can't communicate with a public cloud service, Operations Manager Application Performance Monitoring (APM) might be a viable option for certain limited scenarios. For applications that are not running on legacy platforms but are hosted both on-premises and in any public cloud that allows communication through a firewall (either direct or via a proxy) to Azure, use Azure Monitor Application Insights. This service offers deep, code-level monitoring, with first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, JavaScript, and Node.js.

For any web application that can be reached externally, you should enable a type of synthetic transaction known as [availability monitoring]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability). It's important to know whether your application or a critical HTTP/HTTPS endpoint that your app relies on, is available and responsive. With Application Insights availability monitoring, you can run tests from multiple Azure datacenters and provide insight into the health of your application from a global perspective.

Although Operations Manager is capable of monitoring resources that are hosted in Azure, there are several advantages to including Azure Monitor, because its strengths overcome the limitations in Operations Manager and can establish a strong foundation to support eventual migration from it. Here we review each of those strengths and weaknesses, with our recommendation to include Azure Monitor in your hybrid monitoring strategy.  

#### Disadvantages of using Operations Manager by itself

- Analyzing monitoring data in Operations Manager is commonly performed by using predefined views that are provided by management packs accessed from the console, from SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports, or from custom views that end users have created. Ad hoc data analysis isn't possible out of the box. Operations Manager reporting is inflexible. The data warehouse that provides long-term retention of the monitoring data doesn't scale or perform well. And expertise in writing T-SQL statements, developing a Power BI solution, or using third-party solutions is required to support the requirements for the various personas in the IT organization.

- Alerting in Operations Manager doesn't support complex expressions or include correlation logic. To help reduce noise, alerts are grouped to show the relationships between them and to identify their causes.

#### Advantages of using Operations Manager with Azure Monitor

- Azure Monitor is the way to work around the limitations of Operations Manager. It complements the Operations Manager data warehouse database by collecting important performance and log data. Azure Monitor delivers better analytics, performance (when querying large data volume), and retention than the Operations Manager data warehouse.

  With the Azure Monitor query language, you can create much more complex and sophisticated queries. You can run queries across terabytes of data in seconds. You can quickly transform your data into pie charts, time charts, and many other visualizations. To analyze this data, you're no longer constrained by working with Operations Manager reports that are based on SQL Server Reporting Services, custom SQL queries, or other workarounds.

- You can deliver an improved alerting experience by implementing the Azure Monitor Alerts Management solution. Alerts that are generated in the Operations Manager management group can be forwarded to the Azure Monitor logs Analytics workspace. You can configure the subscription that's responsible for forwarding alerts from Operations Manager to Azure Monitor logs to forward only certain alerts. For example, you can forward only alerts that meet your criteria for querying in support of problem management for trends, and investigation of the root cause of failures or problems, through a single pane of glass. Additionally, you can correlate other log data from Application Insights or other sources, to gain insight that help improve user experience, increase uptime, and reduce time to resolve incidents.

- You can monitor cloud-native infrastructure and applications, from a simple or multitier architecture in Azure, and you can use Operations Manager to monitor on-premises infrastructure. This monitoring includes one or more VMs, multiple VMs placed in an availability set or virtual machine scale set, or a containerized application deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that's running on Windows Server or Linux containers.

- You can use the System Center Operations Manager Health Check solution to proactively assess the risk and health of your System Center Operations Manager management group at regular intervals. This solution can replace or complement any custom functionality you have added to your management group.

- By using the Map feature of Azure Monitor for VMs, you can monitor standard connectivity metrics from network connections between your Azure VMs and on-premises VMs. These metrics include response time, requests per minute, traffic throughput, and links. You can identify failed connections, troubleshoot, perform migration validation, perform security analysis, and verify the overall architecture of the service. Map can automatically discover application components on Windows and Linux systems, and map the communication between services. This automation helps you identify connections and dependencies you were unaware of, plan and validate migration to Azure, and minimize speculation during incident resolution.

- By using Network Performance Monitor, you can monitor the network connectivity between:
  - Your corporate network and Azure.
  - Mission-critical multitier applications and microservices.
  - User locations and web-based applications (HTTP/HTTPS).

This strategy delivers visibility of the network layer, without the need for SNMP. It can also present, in an interactive topology map, the hop-by-hop topology of routes between the source and destination endpoint. It's a better choice than attempting to accomplish the same result with network monitoring in Operations Manager or with other network monitoring tools currently used in your environment.

### Monitor with Azure Monitor

Although a migration to the cloud presents numerous challenges, it also includes a number of opportunities. It enables your organization to migrate from one or more on-premises enterprise monitoring tools to not only potentially reduce capital expenditures and operating costs, but also to benefit from the advantages that a cloud monitoring platform such as Azure Monitor can deliver at cloud scale. Examine your monitoring and alerting requirements, configuration of existing monitoring tools, and workloads transitioning to the cloud. After your plan is finalized, configure Azure Monitor.

- Monitor the hybrid infrastructure and applications, from a simple or multitier architecture where components are hosted between Azure, other cloud providers, and your corporate network. The components might include one or more VMs, multiple VMs placed in an availability set or virtual machine scale set, or a containerized application that's deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) running on Windows Server or Linux containers.

- Enable Azure Monitor for VMs, Azure Monitor for containers, and Application Insights to detect and diagnose issues between infrastructure and applications. For a more thorough analysis and correlation of data collected from the multiple components or dependencies supporting the application, you need to use Azure Monitor logs.

- Create intelligent alerts that apply to a core set of applications and service components, help reduce alert noise with dynamic thresholds for complex signals, and use alert aggregation based on machine learning algorithms to help identify the issue quickly.

- Define a library of queries and dashboards to support the requirements of the various personas in the IT organization.

- Define standards and methods for enabling monitoring across the hybrid and cloud resources, a monitoring baseline for each resource, alert thresholds, and so on.  

- Configure role-based access control (RBAC) so you grant users and groups only the amount of access they need to monitor data from resources they are responsible for managing.

- Include automation and self-service to enable each team to create, enable, and tune their monitoring and alerting configurations as needed.

## Private cloud monitoring

You can achieve holistic monitoring of Azure Stack with System Center Operations Manager. Specifically, you can monitor the workloads that are running in the tenant, the resource level, on the virtual machines, and the infrastructure hosting Azure Stack (physical servers and network switches).

You can also achieve holistic monitoring with a combination of [infrastructure monitoring capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-monitor-health) that are included in Azure Stack. These capabilities help you view health and alerts for an Azure Stack region and the [Azure Monitor service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-metrics-azure-data) in Azure Stack, which provides base-level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services.

If you've already invested in Operations Manager, use the Azure Stack management pack to monitor the availability and health state of Azure Stack deployments, including regions, resource providers, updates, update runs, scale units, unit nodes, infrastructure roles, and their instances (logical entities comprised of the hardware resources). This management pack uses the Health and Update resource provider REST APIs to communicate with Azure Stack. To monitor physical servers and storage devices, use the OEM vendors' management pack (for example, provided by Lenovo, Hewlett Packard, or Dell). Operations Manager can natively monitor the network switches to collect basic statistics by using SNMP. Monitoring the tenant workloads is possible with the Azure management pack by following two basic steps. Configure the subscription that you want to monitor, and then add the monitors for that subscription.
