# Before you start

::: zone-end

The Azure Management Guide helps Azure customers create a management baseline to establish resource consistency across Azure. This guide outlines the basic tools needed for any Azure production environments, especially environments that host sensitive data. For more information, best practices, and considerations related to preparing your cloud environment, see the [Cloud Adoption Framework's readiness section](../index.md).

## Scope of this guide

This guide teaches you how to establish tooling for a management baseline. It also outlines ways to extend the baseline or build resiliency beyond the baseline.

> - **Inventory and visibility:** Create an inventory of assets across multiple clouds. Develop visibility into the run state of each asset.
> - **Operational compliance:** Establish controls and processes to ensure each state is properly configured and running in a well-governed environment.
> - **Protect and recover:** Ensure all managed assets are protected and can be recovered using baseline management tooling.
> - **Enhanced baseline options:** Evaluate common additions to the baseline that might meet business needs.
> - **Platform operations:** Extend the management baseline with a well-defined service catalog and centrally managed platforms.
> - **Workload operations:** Extend the management baseline to include a focus on mission-critical workloads.

## Management baseline

A management baseline is the minimum set of tools and processes that should be applied to every asset in an environment. Several additional options can be included in the management baseline. The next few articles accelerate cloud management capabilities by focusing on the minimum options necessary instead of on all of the available options.
