# Enable server management services on a single VM for evaluation

Learn how to enable server management services on a single VM for evaluation.

> [!NOTE]
> Create the required [Log Analytics workspace and Azure Automation account](./prerequisites.md#create-a-workspace-and-automation-account) before you implement Azure management services on a VM.

It's simple to onboard Azure server management services to individual virtual machines in the Azure portal. You can familiarize yourself with these services before you onboard them. When you select a VM instance, all the solutions on the list of [management tools and services](./tools-services.md) appear on the **Operations** or **Monitoring** menu. You select a solution and follow the wizard to onboard it.
