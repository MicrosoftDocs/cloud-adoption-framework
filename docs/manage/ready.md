# Ready your Azure cloud operations

This article outlines the process to prepare for managing your Azure cloud estate. Organizations achieve successful cloud operations by having the right people, well-defined team structures, and efficient processes. Clear roles and responsibilities create ownership for governance, security, and other critical areas.

## Understand cloud operations

Managing your Azure involves centralized tasks and workload tasks. Centralized tasks support you entire Azure cloud estate. Workload tasks address a single workload. Use *Table 1 *to ensure your operations account for essential cloud operations tasks

*Table 1. Primary cloud operations responsibilities and tasks*

## Establish your cloud operations

With an understanding of essential tasks required in cloud operation. You now need to establish a foundation to fill those functions. Formalize an operational model with defined teams and shared standards. Here’s how:

1.** *Define your cloud operations model.**** *Choose a centralized or shared management model based on your organization's size and maturity. See the following table:

Operations approach

Responsibilities and scope

Best for

Pros

Cons

Centralized

A single team manages all tasks from one place.

Startups or small cloud footprint.

The approach simplifies governance and cost control.

The approach can create operational bottlenecks.

Shared management

A central team handles governance and global tasks while workload teams manage individual workloads.

Enterprises with diverse workloads.

The approach balances governance with workload agility and improves response speed.

The approach requires clear role definitions and ongoing coordination.

1.** *Establish cloud estate operations.*** You need a cloud operations team that can cover all the essential cloud estate tasks. Use *Table 1* to define those operations within the context of your organization. Use *Table 1* to develop a skills matrix to acquire the right personnel.
2.** *Establish workload operations.*** You need a cloud operations team that can cover all the essential workload tasks. Use *Table 1* to get a high-level view of those tasks and develop a skills matrix to acquire the right personnel.

-** *Conduct an Azure Well-Architected Review.*** Use the [Well-Architected Assessment tool](/azure/well-architected/what-is-well-architected-framework#assessment) to regularly reassess each workload. Focus on the Operational Excellence pillar.
-** *Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework.** *Use the recommendations in the [Operational excellence ](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/) pillar implement your workload responsibilities.

1.** *Assign responsibility.**** *Assign named owners for every cloud operational responsibility. In a shared management model, each workload team is responsible for all workload tasks.

## Document your cloud operations

Document your cloud operations. This documentation helps everyone respond in crises and execute changes without causing issues. Define overarching procedures. Build guides for common, specific tasks. Follow these steps:

### <a id="_Define_operational_procedures"></a><a id="_Document_operational_procedures"></a>Document operational procedures

You need to define operational procedures for change, disaster recovery, and daily maintenance tasks that you can’t automate. Here’s how:

1.** *Define change management procedures.*** Change is the major cause of failure in the cloud. Develop a change management process. See [Control Change](#_Control_change).
2.** *Define deployment procedures (release management).** *Standardize deployments, releases, and promotion between environments to maintain configurations. See [Control deployments](#_Control_deployments).
3.** *Define disaster recovery and business continuity procedures.** *Develop a standardized plan to manage failure. See [Manage disaster recovery](#_Manage_disaster_recovery).
4.** *Define additional procedures.** *As needed, define processes for service requests, patches, and configuration management. Maintain these processes in documentation so that every stakeholder understands how to initiate or execute each activity.

### Document operational guides

Prepare step-by-step guides (runbooks or playbooks) for all key operational activities. This preparation ensures consistent execution, even when different people perform the work. It also reduces resolution time under pressure by providing pre-approved steps.

1.** *Define daily tasks.*** Create a manual that explains daily tasks, such as requesting elevated privileges, and reviewing logs. Define standard operating procedures for monitoring, which metrics to watch, alert thresholds, dashboard layouts for each system.
2.** *Create a library of Azure-centric runbooks.** *Include runbooks that address scenarios such as high CPU usage web app, failover and failback using your global load balancer, backup restore, and isolating resources and collecting Azure Activity Logs.
3.** *Store these runbooks in a central repository.*** Use means on-call engineers can quickly access or trigger them when an incident arises.
4.** *Implement operations programmatically.*** Use infrastructure as code as part of a runbook for provisioning common resources. This approach ensures they are built to spec every time.

### Document tools and solutions

Adopt a unified set of tools and processes for cloud operations across the organization. Each team uses a shared monitoring platform, ticketing system, infrastructure-as-code templates, and deployment pipeline. This practice creates consistency and simplifies collaboration. Teams gain clear system visibility and can support each other or assume responsibilities as necessary.

Area

Example benefits

Integration

Standardization simplifies integrations by consolidating logs and code repositories.

Automation

Teams reuse automation scripts and best practices across projects.

Incident management

Incident records capture issues and generate remediation actions that integrate into release cycles.

## Manage your cloud operations

Standardize tools, support coverage, and automation to streamline daily operations. Standardized processes reduce confusion and speed up issue resolution. Align teams with common monitoring, ticketing, and Infrastructure-as-Code practices. Consider these guidelines:

### Manage cloud support

Plan support coverage that addresses critical incidents around the clock. Provide round-the-clock coverage for high-priority cloud workloads. Satisfy service level agreements by ensuring a team member always remains available. Use a follow-the-sun model to shift responsibilities among global teams or establish a defined on-call rotation. Configure [alerts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#configure-alerting) to notify the on-call engineer or team whenever an alert triggers.

### Manage repetitive work

Automate every routine operational task to reduce human error and operational toil. Let Azure handle routine tasks so your team can focus on higher-value work. Use Infrastructure as Code (ARM/Bicep or Terraform templates) for provisioning, Azure Automation runbooks or Functions for maintenance tasks, and CI/CD pipelines for deployments. Where it’s possible, use Azure policy to enforce operational processes.

Automation use case

Examples

Work items

Automate workflows in Azure DevOps Boards or ITSM system. Templates for “Change Request” and “Incident” work items.

Incident response

Integrate Azure Monitor and Azure Service Health with ticketing system to auto-generate incident tickets with standard fields populated.

Change management

Use Azure Automation and Logic Apps to auto-approve low-risk changes or auto-remediate certain incidents.

Compliance

Use Azure Policy to enforce and monitor cloud compliance

Security

Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel to automate security threat detection and response.

Use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to review permissions and automate permissions management.

## Improve operations

Improving operations is about finding ways to optimize your Azure cloud estate. You need to invest in continuous learning and gather feedback. Here’s how:

1.** *Train for operations.** *Bookmark key operational resources. Encourage continuous learning to keep your cloud operations dynamic and up to date. Provide sandbox environments for hands-on learning.

Action

Description

Get credentials

Set goals for [Microsoft credentials](/azure/credentials/), like applied skills and Microsoft Certifications to build expertise.

Use operational resources

See [Azure operational resources](#_Azure_operational_resources).

Use product documentation

Use [Microsoft Learn](/azure/) to find guidance on [Azure services](/azure/?product=popular).

Get hands-on practice

Encourage hands-on practice in non-production sandbox environments.

1.** *Review operations to improve.*** Conduct regular reviews of operational health, governance, security, cost, compliance, data. For example, hold weekly ops review meetings to go over key metrics, recent incidents, changes deployed, and upcoming risks. This discipline of reviewing processes on a set cadence allows teams to continuously improve and ensure procedures remain effective​.
