## Identify your management responsibilities

Effectively managing your Azure environment involves central (platform-wide) responsibilities and workload responsibilities. Central responsibilities support your entire Azure cloud estate. Workload responsibilities focus on an individual workload. Use *Table 1* to ensure your operations account for essential cloud operations responsibilities.

*Table 1. Primary cloud management responsibilities*

## Establish your cloud operations

Use the responsibilities outlined in *Table 1* to build an effective operational foundation. Clearly define teams, standards, and processes by following these steps:

1. ***Define your cloud operations model.*** Choose a centralized or shared management model based on your organization's size and maturity, outlined in the following table:

    | Operations approach | Responsibilities and scope | Best for | Pros | Cons |
    |---------------------|----------------------------|----------|------|------|
    | Centralized         | A single team manages all tasks. | Startups or small cloud footprint. | Simplifies cloud management. | Risks creating bottlenecks. |
    | Shared management   | Separate central (platform) and workload teams | Organizations with diverse workloads. | Balances governance and agility. | Requires clear assignment of responsibility |

1. ***Establish central responsibilities.*** Form a dedicated team to handle central management tasks. Develop a skills matrix from *Table 1* to identify required expertise.

1. ***Establish workload responsibilities.*** Set up specialized teams for workload-specific tasks. Identify responsibilities using *Table 1* then recruit accordingly.

    - ***Conduct an Azure Well-Architected Review.*** Use the [Well-Architected Assessment tool](/azure/well-architected/what-is-well-architected-framework#assessment) to reassess each workload while developing and testing design changes.

    - ***Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework.*** Use the [Operational excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/) pillar to guide your workload management responsibilities.

1. ***Assign responsibility.*** Name specific owners for all cloud management responsibilities. In a shared management model, workload teams should have autonomy to manage their subscriptions.

## Document your cloud operations

Clearly document your cloud operations to enable efficient crisis response and smooth implementation of changes. Establish overarching procedures and create detailed guides for frequent and specific tasks.

### Document operational procedures

Define operational procedures for managing change, disaster recovery, and routine maintenance tasks that automation can't handle. Follow these steps:

1. ***Define change management procedures.*** Change is the major cause of failure in the cloud. Develop a standardized process for managing changes to avoid failures in your cloud environment. See [Manage change](./administer.md#manage-change).

1. ***Define deployment procedures (release management).*** To maintain consistent configuration, standardize your deployments, releases, and environment promotions. See [Manage deployments](./administer.md#manage-cloud-resources).

1. ***Define disaster recovery and business continuity procedures.*** To handle potential failures, prepare a standardized response plan. See [Manage disaster recovery and business continuity](./protect.md#manage-business-continuity).

1. ***Define additional procedures.*** Document processes for managing service requests, patching, and configuration management. Clearly document these processes to ensure stakeholders know how to initiate or complete each task.

### Document operational guides

Create detailed step-by-step guides (runbooks or playbooks) for key operational tasks. This preparation ensures consistent execution, improves efficiency, and shortens resolution times during critical events.

1. ***Define daily tasks.*** Prepare manuals covering daily responsibilities, such as privilege escalation requests and log reviews. Establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for monitoring metrics, alert thresholds, and dashboards for each system.

1. ***Create a library of Azure-centric runbooks.*** Create Azure-specific runbooks addressing scenarios such as:

    | Scenario | Example |
    |----------|-------------|
    | High CPU usage | [Manage scale up in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/manage-scale-up) |
    | Failover and failback | [Failover and failback in Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/failover-failback-overview-modernized) |
    | Blue/green deployments | [Blue/green deployment in Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/blue-green-deployment) |
    | Backup restoration | Backup restore in [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance) and [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/restore-account-continuous-backup) |

1. ***Store these runbooks in a central repository.*** Maintain runbooks in a central repository accessible by on-call engineers for immediate use during incidents.

1. ***Implement operations programmatically.*** Integrate infrastructure-as-code into your runbooks to deploy common resources consistently and accurately each time.

1. ***Review and update.*** Periodically review and revise documentation to reflect operational adjustments and cloud service updates.

### Document tools and solutions

Clear documentation ensures consistency, reduces operational risks, and enhances team efficiency. Create and maintain comprehensive documentation for cloud tools. Regularly update documentation to reflect current practices and ensure easy accessibility for all team members.

| Area | Example benefits |
|-----|----|
| Integration       | Standardization simplifies integrations by consolidating logs and code repositories.               |
| Automation        | Reuse IaC templates across teams, automation scripts, and best practices across projects.                                 |
| Incident management | Capture issues and generate remediation actions that integrate into release cycles. |

## Manage your cloud operations

Effective cloud management optimizes operational efficiency, reduces downtime, and clarifies roles and responsibilities. Standardize your cloud operations through automation and structured support processes. Follow these operational guidelines:

- ***Provide continuous cloud support.*** Establish 24/7 support coverage through either global teams adopting a follow-the-sun model or structured on-call rotations. Define responsibilities clearly to ensure timely response and resolution of critical incidents. Configure automated [alerts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor#configure-alerting) to notify designated support personnel immediately.

- ***Automate repetitive work.*** Use Azure automation capabilities to minimize manual processes and reduce operational overhead. Automate routine activities to eliminate errors, streamline workflows, and enable teams to concentrate on strategic priorities.

    | Use Case            | Examples                                                                                       |
    |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Automation          | Automate workflows in Azure Boards or ITSM system. Templates for "Change Request" and "Incident" work items. |
    | Incident response   | To autogenerate incident tickets with standard fields populated, integrate Azure Monitor and Azure Service Health with ticketing system. |
    | Change management   | Use [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview) to autoapprove low-risk changes or autoremediate certain incidents. |
    | Compliance          | Use Azure Policy to enforce and monitor cloud compliance.                                       |
    | Security            | Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel to automate security threat detection and response. Use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to review permissions and automate permissions management. |

## Improve operations

Optimize your Azure cloud environment by promoting continuous improvement. Regularly evaluate operations and prioritize ongoing learning and feedback. Follow these steps:

1. ***Review operations to improve.*** Follow best practices to [monitor](./monitor.md#configure-monitoring) the health, compliance, security, costs, data, and cloud resources. Conduct weekly operational reviews to discuss key metrics, recent incidents, deployed changes, and anticipated risks. Actively address [resource sprawl](./administer.md#manage-resource-sprawl) and [technical debt](/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/continuous-performance-optimize#address-technical-debt).

1. ***Train for operations.*** Foster ongoing skill development by prioritizing essential learning resources. Maintain dynamic cloud operations through practical training environments. The following table provides resources for operations training.

    | Operations training   | Description  |
    |---|---|
    | Get credentials | Set goals for [Microsoft credentials](/credentials/), like applied skills and Microsoft Certifications to build expertise. |
    | Use operational resources | See [Azure management resources](#azure-management-resources). |
    | Use product documentation | Use [Microsoft Learn](/azure/) to find guidance on [Azure services](/azure/?product=popular). |
    | Get hands-on practice | Encourage hands-on practice in nonproduction sandbox environments. |
