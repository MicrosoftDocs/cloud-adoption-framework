# Cloud adoption antipatterns

Customers often experience cloud adoption [antipatterns](../organize/fiefdoms-silos.md). These missteps commonly occur in design, planning, or implementation when migrating to the cloud. Antipatterns can block innovation and prevent businesses from adopting and realizing goals.

The following table lists antipatterns and the methodologies, or cloud adoption phases, that these patterns occur in. The linked articles provide examples of each antipattern and solutions.
