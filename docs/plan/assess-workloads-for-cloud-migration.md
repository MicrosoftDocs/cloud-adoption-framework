# Assess your workloads for cloud migration

The assessment phase ensures you have full visibility into every component, dependency, and requirement before moving to Azure. By collecting detailed information on architecture, performance, security, code, and databases, you can anticipate issues, minimize risks, and make informed migration decisions.

[!INCLUDE [discovery and assessment table](./includes/discovery-assessment-table.md)]

## Assess workload architecture

Complete architectural assessment gives visibility into all workload components and how they interact. This supports accurate migration planning by identifying what needs to move together and what might require modification.

1. **Use assessment tools.** Tools like Azure Migrate or other products automate discovery of workload components and configurations. These tools reduce manual effort and provide consistent data collection across your environment, though they might miss undocumented dependencies. You can use a tool like Cloudockit to generate your diagrams. You can also create your own by using [Azure icons](/azure/architecture/icons/) or tweaking the downloadable diagrams in [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/).

1. **Validate architecture with subject matter expertise.** Workload owners can confirm tool findings and identify missing or outdated information. Conduct interviews or architecture review sessions to close gaps in the automated discovery data.

1. **Document architecture.** Store architecture diagrams, component lists, and configuration data in a format that supports planning and validation. Use tools like Microsoft Visio, spreadsheets, or Azure DevOps wikis for maintaining this information.

### Assess workload components

For each workload, collect detailed baseline performance and usage metrics from the current environment. This data is critical for right-sizing Azure resources and for comparing performance after migration

1. **Gather workload metrics.**  Track CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O (reads/writes, IOPS), network throughput, and peak concurrency or user load. Identify daily or weekly peaks to understand capacity needs. Measure average response times for user transactions, throughput of jobs processed per hour, and any SLA-related metrics. This helps ensure the migrated workloads meets the same business performance requirements.

1. **Capture configuration details.** Note scaling configurations, current VM sizes or physical server specs (CPU cores, RAM), OS type and version, storage type (SSD/HDD) and capacity, and any special hardware like GPUs. These details inform the choice of Azure VM sizes or PaaS services. Also record software licensing info, as this might enable use of Azure Hybrid Benefit or require license migration.

1. **Document all security and identity configurations.** Inventory all security and identity configurations: list service accounts, any hard-coded credentials, encryption methods used, and firewall rules. These configurations have to be replicated or adjusted in Azure.

    | Security Component | Action | Purpose |
    |-------------------|---------|----------|
    | Identity inventory | Record all service accounts, user accounts, and API keys that applications use for authentication | Affects migration sequencing when you choose between lift-and-shift or modernization approaches |
    | Encryption documentation | Document current encryption methods for data at rest and in transit | Map these requirements to Azure encryption services for maintaining security standards |
    | Network security configuration | Capture network security rules, firewall configurations, and access control lists | Use this information to design Azure network security groups and access policies |

1. **Identify compatibility issues.** Automated tools provide systematic analysis of operating systems, middleware, and application frameworks against Azure support policies. These tools flag components that are unsupported, deprecated, or approaching end of support. Tools like Azure Migrate and other assessment tools can detect these issues across your environment without manual configuration reviews.

1. **List required remediations.** Create a comprehensive list of all compatibility issues and their remediation requirements. Prioritize the ones that must be fixed premigration (blockers) and ones that could be done post-migration if needed. Engage vendors if necessary to understand upgrade paths for commercial software.

### Map internal and external dependencies

1. **Map internal dependencies.** Map how the components of a workload talk to each other and other systems within your organization. Use network monitoring tools or application performance monitoring to see runtime connections between services. This mapping helps determine grouping in migration waves. For example, if App A constantly calls Database B, you either migrate them together or provide network connectivity between Azure and the source environment until both are in cloud.

1. **Identify all external dependencies.** List any external services the workload interacts with. These dependencies include SaaS platforms, partner APIs, on-premises systems, and third-party services that applications require to function properly. You must catalog all upstream and downstream integrations, shared services, and data pipelines to understand the complete dependency landscape. Document APIs, messaging systems, ETL processes, shared databases, authentication methods, data exchange patterns, and service-level agreements. Review integration documentation and conduct interviews with application owners to ensure complete visibility into all external connections. This comprehensive mapping prevents integration failures and supports accurate migration sequencing.

1. **Engage workload owners to validate and complete dependency data.** Workload owners offer critical insights into system behavior, shared resources, and informal integrations that tools might not detect. You must conduct structured interviews or workshops with application and workload owners to validate tool-generated data and identify undocumented dependencies. This step ensures completeness and accuracy of the dependency map and helps capture business context that informs migration sequencing.

1. **Document all dependencies in a central repository.** Store dependency data in a format that supports cross-team collaboration and migration planning, such as spreadsheets, architecture diagrams, or dependency mapping tools. Ensure the repository is accessible and regularly updated to reflect changes during the migration process.

1. **Use dependencies to plan migrations.** Organize workloads into migration waves that minimize broken dependencies For more information, see [Migration wave planning](../migrate/migration-wave-planning.md).

### Assess compliance and operational requirements

1. **Identify regulatory compliance requirements.** A clear understanding of regulatory compliance requirements ensures that your Azure architecture aligns with legal, industry, and organizational obligations. These requirements influence region selection, service availability, data protection, and architectural decisions. Regulatory and compliance standards include global, regional, industry-specific, and internal policies. These standards might include GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, or financial regulations such as SOX. Each standard imposes specific requirements on data handling, access control, encryption, and auditability. You must identify all applicable standards for each workload by consulting legal, compliance, and security stakeholders.

1. **Document SLAs, RPOs, and RTOs.** Service-level agreements (SLAs), recovery point objectives (RPOs), and recovery time objectives (RTOs) define acceptable levels of availability and data loss. These metrics guide the design of backup, replication, and failover strategies. You must document these values for each workload to ensure that the architecture meets business continuity expectations. See [Define reliability requirements](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/protect#define-reliability-requirements).

1. **Classify each workload environment.** Workloads typically run in production, test, or development environments. Each environment has different availability, security, and performance requirements. You must document the environment classification for each workload to inform migration sequencing, access controls, and resource allocation.

1. **Validate ISV integration with Azure.** Many workloads depend on software from independent software vendors (ISVs). You must confirm that all ISV software is compatible with Azure before migration. Use vendor documentation, test environments, or direct validation with the ISV. Identify any required updates, replacements, or configuration changes. Also determine whether Azure Hybrid Benefit or other licensing models apply. Include licensing costs and compatibility adjustments in your migration plan for accurate budgeting and scheduling.

## Assess application code

An application code assessment identifies compatibility issues and modernization opportunities that can affect migration success. This assessment is essential to ensure applications run reliably in Azure and to plan migration waves effectively. You must assess application code to detect blockers early, reduce the risk of migration failure, and inform target architecture decisions.

### Use automated tools to assess application code

1. **Use AppCAT for .NET and Java applications.** [AppCAT](/azure/migrate/appcat/overview) provides detailed assessments for .NET and Java workloads. This tool identifies deprecated APIs, unsupported SDKs, and configuration issues that can prevent successful migration. Use AppCAT to generate compatibility and modernization recommendations for these workloads.

1. **Use third-party tools for other application languages.** Tools such as CloudPilot and CAST Highlight support languages like Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and Go. These tools identify code-level changes required for Azure compatibility and provide modernization insights. Use these tools to assess non-.NET and non-Java workloads.

1. **Use assessment results to inform target architecture decisions.** Application compatibility findings can influence the selection of Azure services. For example, an application that isn't compatible with one service might be compatible with another with minimal code changes. Use this flexibility to migrate applications sooner and defer code modernization to a later phase. This approach reduces migration risk and accelerates time to cloud.

### Validate framework and SDK compatibility

1. **Understand code compatibility.** Framework and SDK compatibility ensures that applications run reliably in Azure. Unsupported versions or incompatible SDKs can cause runtime failures or require significant rework. You must verify that Azure supports your application's language version and framework.

1. **Check Azure support for your application's language and framework.** Confirm that Azure supports your version of [.NET](/azure/dotnet/azure/intro#access-azure-services-from-net-applications), [Java](/azure/developer/java/), [Python](/azure/developer/python/get-started#write-your-python-app), [JavaScript, Node.js](/azure/developer/javascript/core/what-is-azure-for-javascript-development#use-azure-client-libraries-with-javascript), and [Go](/azure/developer/go/overview). Use the official Azure documentation to validate compatibility.

1. **Avoid unnecessary framework changes.** Only migrate to a new framework (such as .NET Framework to .NET Core) if there's a strong business justification. Framework changes require significant development effort and testing.

## Assess databases

Database dependencies often determine the success of application migration. Shared databases, cross-application dependencies, and integration patterns can complicate migration planning. You must assess the databases that support your applications and understand their dependencies. Follow this guidance:

1. **Identify all databases used by the application.** Create a complete inventory of all databases used by the application. Include database engine types (SQL Server, MySQL), versions, and hosting models (for example, on-premises, IaaS, PaaS). Use tools, such as Azure Migrate, to gather this information systematically. Specify whether the database is self-hosted, hosted on virtual machines, or delivered as a managed service. This information helps determine migration readiness and target platform compatibility.

1. **Map inbound and outbound dependencies.** A clear view of how data flows into and out of each database is critical for sequencing migrations and avoiding service disruptions. Dependencies often span multiple applications, services, and external systems. Include internal applications, APIs, batch jobs, reporting tools, and other integrations. Specify whether the dependency is read-only, write-only, or bidirectional. This detail helps prioritize workloads and identify potential migration blockers.

1. **Determine database migration strategy.** Decide whether to move the database as a shared instance or split it by workload. Shared databases simplify management but can delay migration if multiple applications depend on them. Splitting databases enables independent migration but requires careful coordination and testing. Ensure that the database migration plan supports the sequencing of application moves and minimizes downtime or service disruption.

### Create and maintain a risk register

A risk register is a document or tool used to identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor potential risks that could affect cloud adoption and outlines mitigation strategies. Maintaining this register ensures proactive risk management.

1. **Establish a risk register for all workloads.** Record risks related to technical, operational, and organizational factors. This register provides visibility into potential blockers and their value.

2. **Define mitigation strategies and track their status.** For each risk, document mitigation actions, responsible parties, and resolution timelines. This tracking ensures that risks are actively managed and resolved.
