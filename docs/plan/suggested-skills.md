# Get started on a skills readiness path

As more organizations embrace cloud solutions, IT professionals might feel anxious about their roles. Cloud technologies require a different set of skills. However, learning these new skills doesn't have to be hard. With the right training, you can gain the expertise and confidence to help your organization understand and embrace the changing technology landscape.

## Cloud Adoption Framework resources

The Cloud Adoption Framework guides you through the full adoption lifecycle. Each section of the framework provides opportunities to build necessary skills. To help you get started, the following skills-readiness paths describe key skills for success in adoption phases.

- [Strategy phase](../strategy/suggested-skills.md): Develop the skills needed to prepare an actionable migration plan, including business justification and other required business-planning skills.
- [Readiness phase](../ready/suggested-skills.md): Develop the skills needed to prepare the business, culture, people, and environment for coming changes.
- [Migration phase](../migrate/suggested-skills.md): Gain the skills required to implement the cloud migration plan.
- [Management phase - Monitoring](../manage/monitor/monitoring.md): Gain the skills needed to monitor a cloud environment.

Each of these learning paths shares opportunities across multiple media types to maximize knowledge acquisition.

You can also explore certification paths. For more information, see the [Certification process overview](/credentials/certifications/certification-process-overview#getting-started-with-microsoft-certification).
