# Get started on a skills readiness path

IT staff members might feel anxious about their roles and positions as they realize a different set of skills is needed to support cloud solutions. Agile employees who explore and learn new cloud technologies don't need to have that fear. They can lead the adoption of cloud services by helping the organization understand and embrace the associated changes.

The Cloud Adoption Framework guides readers through the full adoption lifecycle. Throughout this framework, readers are provided opportunities to build necessary skills. To help you get started on this journey, skills-readiness articles are included in the following outline for easier access. Each of the following links maps to the skills required to be successful in each of those adoption phases.
