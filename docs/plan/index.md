# Develop a cloud adoption plan

Cloud adoption plans convert the aspirational goals of a cloud adoption strategy into an actionable plan. Your collective cloud teams can use the cloud adoption plan to guide their technical efforts and align them with your organization's business strategy.

Use the following exercises to help you document your organization's technology strategy. These exercises support cloud adoption efforts by capturing prioritized tasks. At the end of this process, your cloud adoption plan will map to the metrics and motivations defined in the cloud adoption strategy.

| |Exercises |
|:---:|---|
