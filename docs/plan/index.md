## Understand the importance of cloud adoption planning

A cloud adoption plan ensures your Azure environment aligns with your business priorities. It provides a structured approach to prepare your organization, people, and technology for cloud adoption. This structure helps you reduce risk, control costs, and accelerate value realization. Cloud adoption planning applies to all organizations:

| Organization Type | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Startups**      | Build cloud-native applications in Azure. See eligibility for [Azure credits](https://www.microsoft.com/startups) |
| **Enterprises**   | Migrate existing workloads from on-premises or other cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and others. |
