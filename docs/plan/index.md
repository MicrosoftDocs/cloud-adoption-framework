# Develop a cloud adoption plan

A cloud adoption plan transforms your strategic vision into executable actions across your organization. This plan coordinates your organization to achieve your cloud objectives. You need a structured approach to ensure your cloud adoption efforts deliver expected business outcomes. Follow this guidance:

1. **Define your adoption approach based on your workload portfolio.** Your workload portfolio determines whether you migrate existing applications, modernize current systems, or build cloud-native solutions. This approach selection impacts your timeline, resource allocation, and skill requirements. Assess each workload's complexity, dependencies, and business value to prioritize your adoption sequence.

2. **Establish your organizational readiness requirements.** Your teams need specific skills and capabilities to execute your cloud adoption plan successfully. This readiness includes technical competencies, governance frameworks, and change management processes. Create learning paths for your teams and identify any skill gaps that require external support or training.

3. **Create your adoption timeline with realistic milestones.** Your timeline balances business urgency with technical feasibility and organizational capacity. This schedule considers dependencies between workloads, resource availability, and risk tolerance. Build buffer time for unexpected challenges and ensure your milestones align with business objectives.

4. **Plan your technology foundation and governance controls.** Your Azure environment requires proper architecture, security, and governance from the start. This foundation includes landing zones, identity management, and compliance frameworks. Establish these controls before you begin workload deployment to prevent technical debt and security risks.

## Align your plan with business outcomes

Business alignment ensures your cloud adoption efforts deliver measurable value to your organization. Your plan must connect technical activities to business metrics and stakeholder expectations. You need clear success criteria and regular review processes to maintain this alignment throughout your adoption journey.

1. **Map technical deliverables to business objectives.** Your cloud adoption activities must directly support your organization's strategic goals. This mapping includes cost optimization targets, performance improvements, and innovation capabilities. Document these connections to maintain focus and demonstrate value to leadership.

2. **Establish measurement and reporting mechanisms.** Your stakeholders need visibility into progress and outcomes throughout the adoption process. This reporting includes technical metrics, financial impact, and business value realization. Create dashboards and regular communications that keep all parties informed of your advancement.
