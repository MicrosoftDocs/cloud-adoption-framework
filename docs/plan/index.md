# Develop a cloud adoption plan

Cloud adoption plans convert the aspirational goals of a cloud adoption strategy into an actionable plan. The collective cloud teams can use the cloud adoption plan to guide their technical efforts and align them with the business strategy.

The following exercises will help you document your technology strategy. This approach captures prioritized tasks to drive adoption efforts. The cloud adoption plan then maps to the metrics and motivations defined in the cloud adoption strategy.
