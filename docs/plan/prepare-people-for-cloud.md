# Prepare your people for the cloud

This article provides guidance to equip your team with the skills necessary for successful Azure adoption. Proper skill development accelerates cloud adoption, reduces implementation risks, and maximizes your return on cloud investments. Follow these recommendations to assess skill needs, develop capabilities, and create a culture of continuous learning that supports your cloud adoption journey.

## Identify the cloud skills you need

A clear understanding of your team's current capabilities and future requirements guides training efforts effectively. Successful Azure adoption requires three skill categories: Azure adoption fundamentals, Azure environment management, and cloud-native development capabilities. You must assess your team's readiness across these three dimensions to create targeted development plans. Follow these recommendations:

1. **Understand the skills required to adopt Azure.** These are the foundational skills needed to begin using Azure securely and effectively. They include Azure [governance](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/), [security](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/overview) ([identity and access management](/entra/fundamentals/introduction-identity-access-management), [networking](/azure/networking/foundations/network-foundations-overview)), [management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/) ([deployments](/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-cloud-resources), [monitoring](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor), [reliability](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/protect#manage-reliability)), and workload design ([cloud architecture](/azure/architecture/guide/), and [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/)).

2. **Understand the skills required to manage Azure.** Effective cloud management ensures your Azure cloud estate aligns with business objectives and minimizes the effects of incidents. Use Cloud Adoption Framework's RAMP (Ready, Administer, Monitor, Protect) process to manage your Azure cloud estate. See [CAF Manage](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/). Use tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub, AI development assistance (GitHub Copilot), and infrastructure as code (Bicep, Terraform, and ARM templates).

3. **Understand the skills required for cloud-native development.** These are skills aligned to your innovation goals, such as [AI development](../scenarios/ai/plan.md#assess-ai-skills) and [cloud-native development](../innovate/index.md), and platform engineering.

## Close the skills gap

After you identify Azure skill gaps, take deliberate steps to close those gaps. Targeted training reduces risk, accelerates delivery, and increases team confidence. If your timeline requires faster results, engage external experts to provide focused support and hands-on guidance.

1. **Train your team using Microsoft Learn.** [Microsoft Learn](/) contains Microsoft product [documentation](/docs), [personalized training](/plans/ai/), [credentials](/credentials/) like [Microsoft Applied Skills](/credentials/applied-skills/) and [Microsoft certifications](/credentials/browse/) aligned to Azure roles. Encourage your team to pursue certifications such as Azure Administrator, Developer, Solutions Architect, or DevOps Engineer. Certifications validate skills and build confidence.

2. **Use expert support to accelerate readiness.** Expert guidance provides hands-on experience and reduces implementation risks when timelines are compressed. Microsoft specialists and trusted partners offer workshops, architectural reviews, and practical training that help teams avoid common pitfalls. You need to engage experts who can provide targeted support aligned to your specific cloud adoption goals. Contact [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/migration/migrate-modernize-innovate/) specialists or find trusted [partners](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) who can deliver workshops, conduct architectural reviews, and provide hands-on guidance tailored to your Azure adoption requirements.

## Sustain cloud skills across your organization

Cloud technology constantly evolves with new Azure services, features, and ecosystem updates released regularly. Organizations that maintain current cloud capabilities outperform those with outdated skills and achieve better business outcomes. You should establish processes that support continuous learning and practical application of new cloud knowledge.

1. **Create a learning sandbox.** Provide a safe, low-risk Azure environment where teams can experiment, test, and learn without affecting production workloads. Use Azure Dev/Test subscriptions to manage costs and access. For an example, see [Azure landing zone sandbox environments](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/sandbox-environments).

2. **Promote continuous learning.** A continuous learning culture ensures teams maintain current Azure skills as cloud technologies evolve. Regular engagement with learning resources keeps your organization prepared for new Azure capabilities and implementation methods. You need to establish structured programs that encourage and reward ongoing skill development.

    a. Dedicate time each week for team members to complete Microsoft Learn modules aligned with your cloud adoption goals
    b. Create a recognition system that tracks Microsoft Learn points and celebrates learning achievements
    c. Schedule regular participation in Azure community events, user groups, and technical sessions
    d. Maintain a curated collection of trusted Azure blogs, videos, and documentation for quick reference on new services and best practices

3. **Implement a skills management program.** A formal program tracks team capabilities, identifies gaps, and aligns training to business priorities. This structured approach ensures your organization maintains the right skills for current and future cloud initiatives. Develop a skills matrix that maps required Azure competencies to roles and create individual development plans that include certification targets.
