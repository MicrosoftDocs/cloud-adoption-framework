# Understand your cloud responsibilities for Azure adoption

This article helps you plan the organizational structure and responsibilities your teams need before adopting Azure. Early planning for governance, security, and operations responsibilities prevents confusion during implementation and ensures all critical functions have designated owners.

## Plan for cloud governance structure

Cloud governance planning establishes who makes decisions about policies, compliance, and risk management before you deploy resources. A well-planned governance structure prevents policy gaps and conflicting standards during your Azure adoption. You need to identify governance roles and responsibilities during your planning phase. Follow this guidance:

1. **Identify governance team members and roles.** Planning requires you to identify individuals who possess the authority and expertise to create policies and enforce compliance. This step ensures governance decisions have proper backing. You must document proposed team members, their roles, and their decision-making authority before forming the team. See [Build a cloud governance team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/build-cloud-governance-team).

2. **Plan governance policy categories.** Your planning phase identifies which policy areas you need including security standards, compliance requirements, cost controls, and resource organization. This categorization guides your future policy development. You need to prioritize policy areas based on your organization's risk profile and regulatory requirements.

3. **Design compliance monitoring approach.** Planning includes determining how you track policy adherence and report violations once operations begin. This design shapes your future monitoring implementation. You must define compliance metrics and reporting frequencies that align with your organizational needs.

## Plan cloud security responsibilities

Security planning determines how your organization assigns protection responsibilities across identity, network, data, and application domains. Clear security role planning prevents gaps in your security coverage when you begin Azure adoption. You must map security functions to specific teams during planning. Follow this guidance:

1. **Map security functions to organizational roles.** Security planning requires you to identify which teams or individuals own each security domain such as identity management, network protection, and data security. This mapping prevents overlapping or missing responsibilities. You need to document each security function and its proposed owner before implementation begins. See [Security Teams, Roles, and Functions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/teams-roles).

2. **Plan security integration points.** Your planning identifies where security teams need to collaborate with development, operations, and governance teams. These integration points ensure security considerations inform all cloud decisions. You must define collaboration processes and review checkpoints for major cloud initiatives.

3. **Design security assessment schedule.** Planning establishes when and how you conduct security reviews, threat assessments, and compliance audits after deployment. This schedule maintains your security posture over time. You need to plan assessment frequencies based on your risk tolerance and compliance requirements.

## Plan cloud operations management structure

Operations planning defines how your organization maintains Azure resources once deployed. A comprehensive operations plan covers monitoring, incident response, and optimization responsibilities before you need them. You must establish operational role assignments during your planning phase. Follow this guidance:

1. **Design operational process framework.** Operations planning creates the structure for future procedures including monitoring strategies, alerting hierarchies, incident response workflows, and change management processes. This framework guides your operational implementation. You need to outline each operational process and its objectives before deployment. See [Ready your Azure cloud operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/ready).

2. **Plan operational role assignments.** Your planning phase identifies which teams or individuals own specific operational areas such as availability management, performance monitoring, and cost optimization. Clear assignments prevent operational confusion. You must create a preliminary responsibility matrix that maps operational functions to proposed owners.

3. **Define service level objectives.** Planning establishes target metrics for availability, performance, and recovery time that guide your future operations. These objectives shape your operational priorities. You need to define realistic service levels based on business requirements and technical capabilities.
