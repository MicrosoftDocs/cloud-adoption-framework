# Prepare your people for Azure

A successful Azure adoption depends on having the right skills in place across your organization to execute responsibilities. Once you define team roles and responsibilities, you must ensure your people have the capabilities to deliver on your cloud plan.

## Assess current and future skill needs

A clear understanding of your team’s current capabilities and future requirements is essential to guide upskilling efforts. Different cloud adoption goals, such as migration, modernization, or building cloud-native solutions, require distinct skill sets. You must assess your team’s readiness across three dimensions:

1. **Identify skills required to adopt Azure.** These are the foundational skills needed to begin using Azure securely and effectively. They include governance, security, identity, networking, and workload design.

1. **Identify skills required for ongoing operations.** These include capabilities for managing, monitoring, and optimizing workloads in Azure. Teams need proficiency in automation, DevOps, infrastructure as code (IaC), and platform operations.

1. **Identify skills required for future cloud ambitions.** These are advanced skills aligned to your long-term goals, such as cloud-native development, AI-assisted development, and platform engineering.

| Cloud Adoption Objective | Cloud Skills Requirement |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cloud adoption | Azure governance, security, management, cloud architecture, and Well-Architected Framework. |
| Tools | Azure DevOps, GitHub, AI development assistance (GitHub Copilot), Infrastructure as code (Terraform, and Bicep). |

## Close identified skill gaps

Once you identify the gaps, take deliberate steps to close those gaps. Upskilling is essential to reduce risk, accelerate delivery, and improve confidence across teams.

1. **Upskill your team using Microsoft Learn.** [Microsoft Learn](/azure/) provides role-based learning paths, [Applied Skills](/azure/credentials/applied-skills/), and certifications aligned to Azure roles. Encourage your team to pursue certifications such as Azure Administrator, Developer, Solutions Architect, or DevOps Engineer. Certifications validate skills and build confidence.

1. **Use expert support to accelerate readiness.** [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/migration/migrate-modernize-innovate/) experts or trusted [partners](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) provide hands-on guidance, workshops, and architectural reviews. These engagements help teams gain practical experience and avoid common pitfalls.

## Sustain skills across the organization

Cloud adoption is not a one-time event. You must create a culture of continuous learning and experimentation to keep pace with Azure innovation.

1. **Create a learning sandbox.** Provide a safe, low-risk Azure environment where teams can experiment, test, and learn without affecting production workloads. Use Azure Dev/Test subscriptions to manage costs and access. For an example, see [Azure landing zone sandbox environments](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/sandbox-environments).

1. **Promote continuous learning.** Encourage ongoing training through Microsoft Learn and internal programs. Gamify learning by recognizing top learners, tracking Microsoft Learn points, and offering monthly rewards.
