# Document the cloud adoption plan

A cloud adoption plan compiles all architectural, operational, and cost decisions into a single reference document. This plan guides the Ready and Adopt phases and ensures alignment across technical and business stakeholders. You must document plans for both migrated and cloud-native workloads, along with the people and process decisions that support adoption. Follow these recommendations:

## Document people and process decisions

A complete cloud adoption plan includes the operating model, team responsibilities, and skilling plans. You must define how teams should operate, who is accountable for each function, and how skills will evolve to support cloud adoption. Ensure that both technical and business stakeholders review and approve the plan to establish shared ownership and alignment.

## Document the plan for each workload you migrate

A migration plan defines how existing workloads transition to Azure. This plan includes an inventory of workloads, the treatment strategy for each workload (such as rehost, refactor, or replace), and the results of assessments that capture specifications, requirements, and dependencies. You must also define success metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the migration. This documentation ensures that migration activities align with business goals and technical constraints.

## Document the plan for each workload you build cloud-native

A cloud-native plan defines the workloads you intend to build directly in Azure using cloud-native services. This plan includes a list of planned workloads, architectural decisions, service selections, and success metrics. You must define how each workload supports business objectives and how it will be deployed and operated in Azure. This documentation ensures that cloud-native development aligns with platform capabilities and governance requirements.

## Align with standards and frameworks

A cloud adoption plan must align with your organization’s project management office (PMO) standards and integrate into existing governance and delivery frameworks. This alignment ensures consistency in planning, reporting, and risk management across all cloud initiatives. You must embed cloud adoption activities into enterprise project structures to ensure visibility, accountability, and control. Follow these recommendations:

1. **Engage stakeholders to validate timelines, dependencies, and resource allocations.** Early engagement ensures that cloud adoption plans reflect enterprise priorities and constraints. This step is critical to avoid misalignment in delivery expectations and to secure necessary support. Schedule planning sessions with PMO representatives to review cloud adoption goals, timelines, and interdependencies.

2. **Use existing project templates, stage gates, and reporting structures to track cloud adoption progress.** Standardized templates and governance checkpoints provide consistency and transparency across projects. This approach reduces duplication of effort and ensures that cloud adoption aligns with enterprise delivery expectations. Integrate cloud adoption activities into the same reporting cadence and format used by other enterprise projects.

3. **Map cloud adoption milestones to enterprise project lifecycle phases.** Aligning cloud milestones with phases such as initiation, planning, execution, and closure ensures that cloud efforts follow familiar delivery patterns. This alignment improves stakeholder understanding and facilitates smoother integration with other initiatives. Define key cloud milestones and associate them with corresponding lifecycle phases in the enterprise project model.

4. **Ensure that cloud adoption risks, issues, and decisions are visible in enterprise governance forums.** Visibility into risks and decisions enables timely escalation and resolution. This step is essential to maintain executive awareness and support. Use existing governance boards or steering committees to review cloud-related risks, mitigation plans, and key decisions.

## Next step

By the end of the Plan phase, you have a cloud adoption roadmap that all stakeholders understand. You’ve made the big decisions: what goes to Azure, how it will go, when it will go, and who will do it. Now it’s time to get your Azure foundation ready.
