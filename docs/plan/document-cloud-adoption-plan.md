# Document your cloud adoption plan

A cloud adoption plan provides a single source of truth for all decisions, estimates, and strategies related to Azure adoption. This documentation ensures alignment across stakeholders, supports governance, and enables continuous refinement of cloud efforts. You must document each component of the plan to ensure visibility, accountability, and traceability.

## Document organization and people plans

1. **Capture the cloud operating model.** Define how cloud services are delivered and managed. Document the structure, roles, and processes that support cloud operations, governance, and support functions.

2. **Record team responsibilities.** Assign clear responsibilities to each team. Document ownership for architecture, security, operations, and business alignment to reduce ambiguity and ensure accountability.

3. **Document the skilling plan.** Outline required training and certifications for each role. Record learning paths and timelines to ensure teams are prepared to support cloud adoption effectively.

4. **Store stakeholder approvals.** Capture approvals from technical and business stakeholders to confirm shared ownership and alignment with the cloud adoption plan.

## Document Azure landing zone and workload details

1. **Record the Azure landing zone architecture.** Document the design of the foundational Azure environment, including networking, identity, security, and governance components. This documentation ensures that the landing zone supports scalability, compliance, and operational readiness.

2. **Maintain a complete workload inventory.** List all workloads targeted for migration or cloud-native development. Include metadata such as workload owner, business criticality, and dependencies. This inventory provides visibility into workload priorities and interdependencies.

3. **Document migration plans.** For each workload, record the migration strategy (retire, rehost, refactor, rearchitect, replace, retain), success metrics, assessment results, target architecture, and cost estimates. Use the guidance in [Migration adoption plan](./migration-adoption-plan.md) to ensure consistency and alignment.

4. **Document cloud-native workload plans.** For each planned cloud-native workload, record the architecture, requirements, success metrics, and cost estimates. Use the guidance in [Cloud-native adoption plan](./cloud-native-adoption-plan.md) to support effective planning and execution.

## Document alignment with standards and frameworks

1. **Record alignment with PMO standards.** Document how the cloud adoption plan aligns with project management methodologies, including required artifacts and approval gates.

2. **Capture integration with governance processes.** Document how cloud adoption activities are embedded into enterprise governance, including risk management and compliance tracking.

3. **Document reporting and accountability structures.** Record how progress is tracked and reported, and who is accountable for each aspect of the plan.

## Document estimated timelines

1. **Record estimated timelines for each workload.** Use available data and business drivers to estimate when each workload will be production-ready in Azure. This step ensures alignment with organizational priorities and resource planning.

2. **Capture key milestones and dependencies.** Document major phases, dependencies, and blockers to support planning and risk mitigation. This documentation provides visibility into critical path activities and potential risks.

3. **Include a process for timeline updates.** Define how and when timelines will be reviewed and adjusted to reflect actual progress. This process ensures that plans remain accurate and actionable throughout the adoption lifecycle.

## Next step

By the end of the Plan phase, you have a cloud adoption roadmap that all stakeholders understand. Youâ€™ve made the big decisions: what goes to Azure, how it will go, when it will go, and who will do it. Now itâ€™s time to get your Azure foundation ready.
