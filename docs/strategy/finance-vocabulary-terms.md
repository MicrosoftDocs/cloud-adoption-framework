# Glossary of common finance terms

Use these common finance terms when your team is creating a cloud migration business case. These terms can help when you share your business case with a finance team.

## Terms

**Amortization**:  An expense tied to a typically intangible asset, that reflects the “economic” usage of that asset in a particular time period. For example if you purchase a license worth $100, you would capitalize that on your balance sheet. If you amortized it over 5-years, you would annually recognize an expense of $20 per year that impacts your income statement.

**Balance sheet**: A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity as of a specific date.

**Capital Expense (CAPEX)**: The upfront investment in equipment. This equipment is capitalized as an asset and put on your balance sheet.

**Cash flow statement**: A cash flow statement is a financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company during a given period.

**Cloud economics**: An understanding of the benefits and costs of the cloud, and the financial impact when you start a migration from on-premises to cloud computing.

**Depreciation**: An expense tied to a capitalized asset, that reflects the “economic” usage of that asset in a particular time period. For example if you purchase a server worth $100, you would capitalize that on your balance sheet. If you depreciated it over 5-years, you would annually recognize an expense of $20 per year that impacts your income statement.

**Double mortgage period**: A period when you have two sets of costs at the same time. For example, when you have both on-premises and cloud costs.

**Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)**: A performance indicator of the profitability of a business. This starts from “operating income” which is the income from your ongoing business operations (ignoring things like taxes or interest expense) and adds back depreciation and amortization. While a useful performance metric that is used for comparability, it is often viewed in conjunction metrics like Capital Expenditure to have a better all-up understanding of a companies ability to generate free cash flow.

**Net Present Value (NPV)**: An assessment of the financial value of a business investment. This metric looks at cash flows, timing, and the required interest rate.

**Operating Expense (OPEX)**: The ongoing expenses for a business. For example, a maintenance payment or periodic bill for Azure services.

**Profit and Loss (P&L)**: A financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred over a specified period, usually a fiscal quarter, or year. It is also referred to as the income statement.

**Return on Investment (ROI)**: Return on investment (ROI) is a metric used to understand the profitability of an investment. ROI compares how much you paid for an investment to how much you earned to evaluate its efficiency.
