# Define your cloud strategy team

This article outlines the process for defining your cloud strategy team. A cloud strategy team or function defines the motivations and business objectives for cloud adoption and transformation projects. These functions validate and maintain alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts.

Establishing a _motivation-driven strategy_ helps you map and align the initiatives with the desired business objectives. The cloud strategy team helps facilitate the alignment between the business and the adoption initiatives.

## Why do I need a cloud strategy team?

Consider these reasons for establishing a cloud strategy team:

- _Align business and IT objectives_. Ensure that your cloud initiatives are purpose-driven, are tied to your motivations, and address specific business needs and priorities.
- _Improve strategic decision making_. Bring diverse perspectives to evaluate cloud capabilities and select solutions that are aligned with organizational goals.
- _Accelerate cloud transformation_. Streamline the adoption process by creating a cohesive roadmap and clear ownership of initiatives.
- _Reduce operational risks_. Identify and mitigate potential challenges in security, compliance, and governance.
- _Enhance innovation and flexibility_. Foster a collaborative environment that encourages innovative uses of cloud technology and increases responsiveness to market changes.

## Recommended functions

To successfully implement a cloud strategy team and help your business realize value from your cloud investments, consider including the following functions in your cloud strategy team. You can start small and expand the team over time. Start by consulting stakeholders from across the organization and add more functions to your adoption strategy team as necessary.

Here's a list of typical functions and their relevance for a cloud adoption strategy:

- _Central IT_ helps manage operational efficiency, optimizes IT resources, prepares the technical platforms, and ensures the scalability and availability of cloud services.
- _Business decision makers (BDM)_ ensure that cloud strategies drive business value and align with revenue generation, customer engagement, and operational goals.
- _IT decision makers (ITDM)_ bridge the gap between technology and business. They help balance technological feasibility with business needs and ensure that new solutions align with existing IT frameworks and capabilities.  
- _Lead architects_ translate the business objectives into technical architectures that ensure cloud solutions are secure, scalable, reliable, and adaptable.
- _Cloud security teams_ help ensure that you protect your data end systems. They ensure that new initiatives follow security standards to reduce the risks that are associated with cloud adoption.
- _Compliance teams_ minimize legal and compliance risks. They help ensure that all cloud practices meet regulatory and organizational compliance standards.
- _Financial teams_. Consider including representatives from financial teams to help inform the IT and business decision makers about the opportunities and risks of cloud investments.
- _Executives_ provide top-down support and strategic oversight. Including someone from your leadership team or executive stakeholders can help drive organizational commitments to ensure that cloud adoption aligns with the companyâ€™s overall mission and strategic objectives.

## Seek input

Your cloud strategy team should continuously seek input from across the business. Consider ensuring alignment and seeking input from these additional teams and personas:

- _Finance leadership_ guides budgeting, cost management, and financial planning. They help maximize the return on cloud investments by ensuring financial efficiency and compliance with corporate financial policies.
- _Marketing_ shapes brand reputation and customer engagement strategies. They ensure that cloud capabilities support customer acquisition, retention, and digital marketing initiatives to enhance overall brand image.
- _Sales_ drives revenue growth and builds customer relationships. They align cloud solutions with sales goals to help streamline sales processes, boost efficiency, and improve customer lifetime value.
- _Human resources (HR)_ provides insights and support that directly influence the success and sustainability of the transformation. If you have recruitment, re-skilling, or workforce planning requirements because of new areas for innovation, HR is a crucial partner.
- _Executive leadership_ helps you meet market growth requirements and environmental sustainability metrics. 
- _Sustainability leads_ drive sustainability as part of the cloud strategy throughout the business, ensuring sustainability is aligned with the company's environmental commitments.

## Recommendations

- _Start small and expand_. Define the core members of the initial team. Core members at this stage typically include IT, finance, and security. Seek input from other functions as necessary for the first iterations of your strategy.

- _Define the role of your strategy team_. Ensure that you map your business requirements and objectives to the operational responsibility of the cloud adoption strategy team. A clear accountability structure helps when you communicate organizational changes or invest in new initiatives to enhance your cloud maturity.

- _Review the strategy team memberships_. Regularly review the strategy team to ensure that you have representation across the business and that you have the right stakeholders and collaborators involved. Doing so helps uncover both opportunities and risks. Both should be fairly represented as the strategy evolves.

- _Iterate on your strategy_. Create an initial strategy draft with your core team, consulting with business leaders and stakeholders. Use the first iteration to explore business goals that you can achieve through cloud adoption. When you have executive support to proceed, expand the scope and detail of your strategy team as necessary.
