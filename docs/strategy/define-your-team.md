Establishing a _motivation-driven strategy_ helps you map and align the initiatives with the desired business objectives. The cloud strategy team helps facilitate the alignment between the business and the adoption initiatives.

## Why do I need a cloud strategy team?

Consider these reasons for establishing a cloud strategy team:

- _Align business and IT objectives_. Ensure that your cloud initiatives are purpose-driven, are tied to your motivations, and address specific business needs and priorities.
- _Improve strategic decision making_. Bring diverse perspectives to evaluate cloud capabilities and select solutions that are aligned with organizational goals.
- _Accelerate cloud transformation_. Streamline the adoption process by creating a cohesive roadmap and clear ownership of initiatives.
- _Reduce operational risks_. Identify and mitigate potential challenges in security, compliance, and governance.
- _Enhance innovation and flexibility_. Foster a collaborative environment that encourages innovative uses of cloud technology and increases responsiveness to market changes.

## Recommended functions

To be successful with implementing a cloud strategy team and help your business realize value with your cloud investments, consider including the following functions in your cloud strategy team. You can start small and expand the team over time. Start by consulting stakeholders from across the organization and add more functions to your adoption strategy team as necessary.

Here's a list of typical functions and how they're relevant for a cloud adoption strategy:

- _Central IT_. Helps manage operational efficiency, optimizes IT resources, prepares the technical platforms, and ensures the scalability and availability of cloud services.
- _Business decision makers (BDM)_. Ensures that cloud strategies drive business value and align with revenue generation, customer engagement, and operational goals.
- _IT decision makers (ITDM)_. Bridges the gap between technology and business. Helps balance technological feasibility with business needs and ensure that new solutions align with existing IT frameworks and capabilities.  
- _Lead architects_. Translates the business objectives into technical architectures that ensure cloud solutions are secure, scalable, reliable, and adaptable.
- _Cloud security teams_. Representatives from your security teams help ensure you protect your data end systems, ensuring new initiatives follow security standards and reduce the risks associated with cloud adoption.
- _Compliance teams_. Minimizes legal and compliance risks. Ensures that all cloud practices meet regulatory and organizational compliance standards.
- _Financial teams_. Consider having representatives from financial teams to help inform the IT and Business Decision Makers about the opportunities and risks of cloud investments.
- _Executives_. Provides top-down support and strategic oversight. Having someone from your leadership team or executive stakeholders can help drive organizational commitments, ensuring that cloud adoption aligns with the company’s overall mission and strategic objectives.

## Seek input

Your cloud strategy team should continuously seek input from areas across the business. Consider ensuring alignment and seeking input from these additional teams and personas:

- _Finance leadership_. Guides budgeting, cost management, and financial planning. Helps maximize the return on cloud investments, ensuring financial efficiency and compliance with corporate financial policies.
- _Marketing_. Shapes brand reputation and customer engagement strategies. Ensures cloud capabilities support customer acquisition, retention, and digital marketing initiatives, enhancing overall brand value.
- _Sales_. Drives revenue growth and improves customer relationships. Aligns cloud solutions with sales goals, helping to streamline sales processes, boost efficiency, and improve customer lifetime value.
- _Human resources (HR)_. Involve HR in your cloud adoption strategy to get insights and support that directly influence the success and sustainability of the transformation. If you have recruitment, re-skilling, or workforce planning requirements because of new areas for innovation, HR will be a crucial partner.
- _Executive leadership_. Meeting market growth requirements and environmental sustainability metrics. 
- _Sustainability leads_. Driving sustainability as a strategy throughout the business, aligned with the company’s commitments.

## Recommendations for defining your cloud strategy team

- _Start small and expand_. Define the core members of the initial team, which typically should include IT, finance, and security. Seek input from other functions as necessary for the first iterations of your strategy.

- _Define the role of your strategy team_. Ensure you map your business requirements and objectives to the operational responsibility of the cloud adoption strategy team. Having a clear accountability structure in place will help when you communicate organizational changes or invest in new initiatives to enhance your cloud maturity.

- _Review the strategy team memberships_. Make a habit to regularly review the strategy team and ensure you’ve got representation across the business, ensuring you’ve got the right stakeholders and collaborators involved over time. This will help uncover both opportunities and risks, and both should be fairly represented as the strategy evolves.

- _Iterate on your strategy_. Create an initial strategy draft with your core team in consultation with business leaders and stakeholders. Use the first iteration to explore business goals that can be achieved through cloud adoption. Once you have executive support to proceed, expand the scope and detail of your strategy team as necessary.
