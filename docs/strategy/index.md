# Develop a cloud adoption strategy

The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can help your enterprise execute multiple business strategies. By using cloud-based approaches, you can improve business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and enable expansion into new markets. To take advantage of this great potential, start by documenting your business strategy in a way that's both understandable to cloud technicians and palatable to your business stakeholders.

The following steps can help you document your business strategy efficiently. This approach helps you drive adoption efforts that capture targeted business value in a cross-functional model. Then, you can map your cloud adoption strategy to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach your desired state of transformation.
