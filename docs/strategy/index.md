# Develop a cloud adoption strategy

A cloud strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines an organization's approach to adopting and integrating cloud technologies to achieve business goals.

Establishing a cloud strategy involves understanding the specific needs and objectives of the business and ensuring alignment with overall business goals.

The journey to successfully maturing in the cloud, or to expanding your footprint, starts with the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Strategy methodology. Organizations typically mature in iterations – consider the CAF Strategy guide an iterative supplement to your cloud strategy and come back to re-assess and iterate regularly.

Whether you're an existing cloud customer looking to mature in new areas or if you’re new to the cloud, this guidance will help you establish a clear mission, goals, measurable results, and to inform your strategy about key considerations from a strategic perspective for your cloud investments.

## Why do you need a cloud adoption strategy?

A cloud strategy is important for business success because:

- Cloud is a means to an end: It's a tool that should serve as a way to achieve business success. Therefore, cloud adoption should be aligned with business objectives, measured for effectiveness, and subject to continuous improvement.  

- A solid, ongoing strategy is important: Without a well-defined and continuously evolving cloud strategy, organizations may face unexpected costs, siloed work environments, and failure to realize the expected value of cloud investments.

- It aligns the organization: By creating and publishing a strategy with input from stakeholders, you can align the interests of business units across the organization and ensure that every team is supportive and benefits from cloud adoption.
