# Develop a cloud adoption strategy

A cloud adoption strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines your organization's approach when you adopt and integrate cloud technologies. A cloud adoption strategy helps you align with business goals.

To establish a cloud adoption strategy, you must understand the specific needs and objectives of your business so that you can effectively align with overall business goals.

The journey to successfully maturing in the cloud, or to expanding your footprint, starts with the Cloud Adoption Framework Strategy methodology, which consists of the following five steps.

Organizations typically mature in iterations. Consider the Cloud Adoption Framework Strategy guide an iterative supplement to your cloud adoption strategy. Revisit the guide to reassess and iterate regularly.

Whether you're an existing cloud customer who wants to mature your cloud environment or you're new to the cloud, this guidance helps you establish a clear mission, goals, and measurable results. It also provides strategic insights to help you make informed decisions about your cloud investments.

## Benefits of a cloud adoption strategy

Use a cloud adoption strategy to help you:

- **Realize value.** A well-defined cloud adoption strategy helps you realize the full value of your cloud investments. Optimize cloud investments to provide financial efficiency, cost optimization, and business agility.

- **Ensure business-driven decisions.** Align cloud adoption with business goals to maximize value and support measurable outcomes.
- **Drive alignment among cross-functional teams.** Foster collaboration among business, IT, and finance teams to achieve unified goals.
- **Mitigate modernization risks.** Create a roadmap to safely rearchitect legacy systems and integrate cloud technologies.
- **Enable continuous strategy improvement.** Use a well-defined and continuously evolving cloud adoption strategy to better address challenges, like unexpected costs, siloed work environments, and unrealized cloud investment value.

## Cloud adoption strategy checklist

The following checklist provides an overview of the tasks for each cloud adoption strategy step. Focus on the startup tasks if your organization is smaller and might have fewer resources. Focus on the enterprise tasks if your organization is larger and has extensive resources. Some tasks correspond to both scenarios.
