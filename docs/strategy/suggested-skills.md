# Skills readiness path during the Plan phase of a migration journey

During the Plan phase of a migration journey, the objective is to develop the plans necessary to guide migration implementation. This phase requires a few critical skills, including:

- Establishing the vision.
- Building the business justification.
- Rationalizing the digital estate.
- Creating a migration backlog (technical plan).

The following sections provide learning paths to develop each of these skills.

## Establish the vision

The success of any cloud adoption effort is defined by the business vision. When the technical team doesn't understand the motives and desired outcomes, it's hard for them to guide their efforts toward business success. See these articles for information about documenting and articulating the business vision for the technical team:

- [Adoption motivations](./motivations.md). Document and articulate the reasons behind the technical effort.
- [Business outcomes](./business-outcomes/index.md). Clearly articulate what's expected of the technical team in terms of business changes.
- [Learning metrics](./learning-metrics.md). Establish short-term metrics that can show progress toward longer-term business outcomes.

## Build the business justification

Justifying the investment to adopt the cloud can require deeper analysis and an understanding of your organization's accounting practices. The articles on business justification can help you develop these skills:

- [Cloud migration business case](./cloud-migration-business-case.md). Establish a business case for cloud migration.

## Rationalize the digital estate

You can refine your business case by aligning the desired business case with current and future digital estate inventory. These articles can guide the development of a digital estate rationalization:

- [Incremental rationalization](../digital-estate/rationalize.md). An agile approach to rationalization that properly aligns late-bound technical decisions.
- [Rs of rationalization](../digital-estate/5-rs-of-rationalization.md). Understand the various rationalization options.

## Create a migration backlog (technical plan)

Convert the business case and rationalized digital estate into an actionable migration plan to guide the technical activities required to achieve the desired business outcomes.

## Business planning skills

During the Ready phase, technical staff creates a migration landing zone capable of hosting, operating, and governing workloads that have been migrated to the cloud. These learning paths can help you develop the necessary skills:

- [Create an Azure account](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account). The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services you provision and handles your personal settings, like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal). Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure). Get started with Azure by creating and configuring your first virtual machine in the cloud.
- [Introduction to security in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure). Learn the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.

- [Data storage options](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-data-in-azure/index). Learn about the benefits of Azure data storage.

## Organizational skills

Depending on the motivations and desired business outcomes of a cloud adoption effort, leaders might need to establish new organizational structures or virtual teams (v-teams) to facilitate various functions. These articles will help you develop the skills necessary to structure those teams to meet desired outcomes:

- [Initial organizational alignment](../organize/index.md). Overview of organizational alignment and various team structures to facilitate specific goals.
- [Breaking down silos and fiefdoms](../organize/fiefdoms-silos.md). Understanding two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide a team to productive collaboration.

## Deeper skills exploration

Beyond these initial options for developing skills, a variety of learning options is available.

### Typical mappings of cloud IT roles

Microsoft and partners offer various options to help all audiences develop their skills with Azure services:

- [Microsoft IT Pro Center](https://www.microsoft.com/itpro). Serves as a free online resource to help map your cloud career path. Learn what industry experts suggest for your cloud role and the skills to get you there. Follow a learning curriculum at your own pace to build the skills you need most to stay relevant.

We recommend turning knowledge of Azure into official recognition with [Microsoft Azure certification training and exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-certification.aspx).

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn is a new approach to learning. Readiness for the new skills and responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily.
