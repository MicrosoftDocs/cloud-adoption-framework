# Why are you moving to or expanding in the cloud?

This article aims to help you understand and define motivations for your cloud adoption strategy. This is crucial for IT decision-makers and executives as it ensures alignment with strategic business objectives, maximizes return on investment, and facilitates informed decision-making.

Clear motivations help prioritize initiatives, streamline resource allocation, and mitigate risks by addressing specific business needs such as reducing operational costs, enhancing security, and driving innovation.  

By articulating these motivations, organizations can harness the full potential of cloud technologies, improve agility, and maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Motivations for cloud adoption can be achieved either *directly* or *indirectly*. For instance, improving your resilience or optimizing your costs may be the direct result of moving from on-premises architecture into Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) in the cloud. Alternatively, they can be an *indirect* outcome of other improvements, such as accelerating the delivery of business applications.

## Define your motivations

While motivations for adopting and expanding your cloud footprint are many, here are some of the common motivation examples you might encounter.  

Use these examples to guide your decision making and inform your strategy.

### Reduce business risk  

- *Security*: Utilize advanced security offerings to protect your assets.
- *Sustainability*: Achieve carbon savings and enhance green IT compliance.
- *Resiliency*: Increase redundancy and resilience through cloud capabilities, including multi-region deployments.
- *Business continuity*: Use the capabilities of the cloud for high availability (HA) and uptime guarantees and establish disaster recovery (DR) routines with reliable backup and recovery solutions.
- *Datacenter modernization*: Modernize infrastructure with reduced hardware and staffing. Upgrade by migrating to Azure for enhanced capabilities.
- *Data governance*: Minimize risks by implementing robust data governance, ensuring compliance and security across decentralized data sources.
- *Compliance management*: Minimize compliance risks with policies that block or alert deployments not aligned to your compliance requirements.  
- *Financial transparency*: Finance and leadership teams get more visibility into financial aspects of the cloud investments, including detailed billing and usage reports.
- *Cloud scale*: Use the cloud’s built-in redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities to ensure business continuity, and to mitigate operational risks.

### Accelerate innovation  

- *AI*: Access cutting-edge AI capabilities for transformative solutions.
- *Cloud-native*: Benefit from exclusive cloud capabilities unavailable elsewhere.
- *Security*: Utilize robust security controls to enhance innovation securely.
- *Customer solutions*: Develop SaaS offerings and consumer apps efficiently.
- *Shared responsibility*: Focus IT efforts on delivering business value.
- *Data empowerment*: Use accessible data to democratize insights, driving rapid, data-driven innovation across teams.
- *Compliance empowerment*: Apply policies to make compliance a feature of solutions you develop as opposed to an assessment that needs to be passed after the fact.
- *Cost flexibility*: Use the Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG) cost model to easily drive short-term innovative projects and Proof-of Concept (PoC) solutions without the need to own anything when you shut it down.

## Enhance agility and efficiency

- **Profitability improvement potential**: Accelerate business growth and optimize investments with operational efficiency opportunities, cloud innovation, enhanced security, flexibility, and scalability.
- **Multicloud opportunities**: Support multi-cloud strategies with Azure integration.
- Rapid prototyping: Quickly prototyping and access services like AI and robotic process automation (RPA).
- **Simplified operations**: Using consistent tooling and platforms across your estate improves visibility and enables collaborative working across technical disciplines.
- **Decoupled data services:** Independent, scalable data services, that free application architecture from data dependencies and enable agility in application development.
- **Cloud-scale**: Utilize modern capabilities for scaling up and down with your business requirements.
- **Software-defined compliance**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) and software-based policy controls enable you to more easily adjust to regulation changes.

## Classify motivations

After you identify your motivations and key considerations, you need to assess the needs and prioritize them. Follow these steps when you document your motivations:

- *Assess needs*: Identify which motivations align with your organization’s strategic goals.
- *Prioritize*: Define the priority and urgency for each line item in each motivation.
- *Iterate and review:* Regularly revisit and adjust priorities as the business needs evolve. When you later define your mission and goals, you will link them to your motivations and expand as necessary.

### Example classification

Here's an example classification of motivations and key considerations, mapped to the business priority and urgency.

| **Motivation category** | **Category** | **Priority** | **Urgency** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Reduce business risk | Security | High | High |
| Reduce business risk | Sustainability | Medium | Low |
| Reduce business risk | Resiliency | High | Medium |
| Accelerate innovation | AI | High | High |
| Accelerate innovation | Customer solutions | High | Medium |
| Enhance agility and efficiency | Maximize investments | High | High |

Use your classified motivations to inform the priorities and urgency in your goals.
