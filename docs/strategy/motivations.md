- **Financial transparency:** Gain more visibility into financial aspects of cloud investments for leadership teams, including detailed billing and usage reports.

- **Cloud scale:** Use the cloud's built-in redundancy and DR capabilities to help ensure business continuity and mitigate operational risks.

### Accelerate innovation  

- **AI:** Access cutting-edge AI capabilities for transformative solutions.

- **Cloud native:** Benefit from exclusive cloud capabilities that aren't available elsewhere.

- **Security:** Use robust security controls to securely enhance innovation.

- **Customer solutions:** Develop software as a service offerings and consumer apps efficiently.

- **Shared responsibility:** Focus IT efforts on delivering business value.

- **Data empowerment:** Use accessible data to democratize insights. This strategy drives rapid, data-driven innovation across teams.

- **Compliance empowerment:** Apply policies to make compliance a feature of the solutions that you develop instead of an assessment that they need to pass later.

- **Cost flexibility:** Use the pay-as-you-go cost model to easily drive short-term innovative projects and proof-of-concept solutions without the need to own anything when you shut them down.

### Enhance agility and efficiency

- **Profitability improvement potential:** Accelerate business growth and optimize investments by using operational efficiency opportunities, cloud innovation, enhanced security, flexibility, and scalability.

- **Multicloud opportunities:** Support multicloud strategies by using Azure integration.

- **Rapid prototyping:** Quickly prototype and access services like AI and robotic process automation.

- **Cloud scale:** Use modern capabilities to scale up and down according to your business requirements.

- **Software-defined compliance:** Infrastructure as code and software-based policy controls allow you to more easily adjust to regulation changes.

## Classify motivations

After you identify your motivations and key considerations, you need to assess and prioritize your needs. Follow these steps when you document your motivations:

- **Assess needs:** Identify which motivations align with your organization's strategic goals.

- **Prioritize:** Define the priority and urgency for each line item in each motivation.

- **Iterate and review:** Revisit and adjust priorities regularly as the business needs change. When you later define your mission and goals, link them to your motivations and expand as necessary.

### Example classification

The following table lists examples of classifications of motivations and key considerations that are linked to business priority and urgency.

| Motivation category | Consideration | Priority | Urgency |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Reduce business risk | Security | High | High |
| Reduce business risk | Sustainability | Medium | Low |
| Reduce business risk | Resiliency | High | Medium |
| Accelerate innovation | AI | High | High |
| Accelerate innovation | Customer solutions | High | Medium |
| Enhance agility and efficiency | Maximize investments | High | High |

Use your classified motivations to inform the priorities and urgency of your goals.

## Define your mission and objectives

For a successful cloud adoption, you must define your mission and objectives. A clear mission provides direction and purpose. The objectives outline the steps that you take to achieve that mission. A mission is only valuable if you can take action on it, achieve objectives effectively, and measure the results.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following section uses OKRs to show examples of how you can break down your cloud adoption strategy objectives into measurable key results. But you can use this guidance and these examples with any methodology or framework when you define and measure your business goals.

### Mission statement and objectives

Your cloud adoption strategy should clarify the role of the cloud within your organization. It should also define how and when you apply the cloud to support the objectives and desired outcomes of your business, digital, and IT strategies.

#### Mission statement

A mission statement helps you align your objectives and key results to your organization's overall business mission.

To help you derive a statement for your business, consider these initial questions:

- **Why:** Why are you moving to or expanding in the cloud?
- **What:** What are your business objectives?
- **How:** How do you intend to measure success?

Use the answers to these questions to help define your mission statement for your cloud strategy. For example:

- **Mission statement:** "Use cloud technologies that align with our business and IT goals to empower our organization to innovate, scale, and deliver secure, high-quality services."

#### Objectives

Ensure that your objectives include clear and inspiring goals that align with the mission statement. For example:

- **Objective for security:** "Use advanced security offerings to protect your assets."
- **Objective for compliance:** "Use advanced compliance offerings to audit your assets."
- **Objective for datacenter modernization:** "Modernize infrastructure with reduced hardware and staffing. To upgrade the datacenter, migrate to Azure for enhanced capabilities."

**Recommendations:**

To define your mission and objectives, consider the following recommendations.

- _Meet with and involve key stakeholders across your organization._ Ensure that you clearly represent the business and departmental mission and objectives and that all stakeholders understand them. You might include problem statements that a cloud adoption addresses.

- _Define and align cloud adoption objectives and key results._ Clearly define, refine, and align the cloud objectives with your organization's mission and objectives.

- _Define key results for objectives._ After you define and align objectives, establish specific key results to achieve the objectives, including key performance indicators (KPIs), to measure progress.

- _Establish accountability._ Ensure key results have accountable roles assigned to them and ensure that key results and associated KPIs are reviewed periodically, preferably at least quarterly at the strategic level.

- _Prioritize clarity._ Ensure that your objectives, key results, and accountability are clear, concise, accessible and easy to understand for everyone.

### Measure success

To understand if you're on track to meet your objectives, you must be able to effectively measure and track your key results. Establish KPIs or other ways to gauge progress on your mission and objectives.

These metrics should provide insights into your progress against each key result and highlight areas for improvement.  

**Recommendations:**

To measure your success, use these guidelines when you define metrics.

- _Define KPIs._ Set clear metrics that you can measure against each related key result.

- _Review regularly._ Schedule and perform regular reviews to assess progress.

- _Be agile._ Iterate and adjust your strategy and ways to measure progress. Cloud innovation rapidly changes the technical landscape and the opportunities to apply clever solutions.
