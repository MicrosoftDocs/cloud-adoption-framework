# What business outcomes are associated with transformation journeys?

The most successful transformation journeys start with a business outcome in mind. Cloud adoption can be a costly and time-consuming effort. Fostering the right level of support from IT and other areas of the business is crucial to success. This article series is designed to help customers identify business outcomes that are concise, defined, and drive observable results or change in business performance, supported by a specific measure.

During any cloud transformation, the ability to speak in terms of business outcomes supports transparency and cross-functional partnerships. The business outcome framework starts with a simple template to help technically minded individuals document and gain consensus. This template can be used with several business stakeholders to collect a variety of business outcomes, which could each be influenced by a company's transformation journey. Feel free to use this template electronically or, better still, draw it on a whiteboard to engage business leaders and stakeholders in outcome-focused discussions.

To learn more about business outcomes and the business outcome template, see [Documenting business outcomes](./business-outcome-template.md), or download the [business outcome template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/strategy/business-outcome-template.xlsx).

## Prepare for conversations with different personas

The following are a few business outcomes that tend to trigger conversations with various personas:

- **Finance leadership:** Increase profitability while driving compliance.
- **Marketing:** Acquire and retain customers, build reputation.
- **Sales:** Accelerate sales, improve customer lifetime value.
- **Human resources:** Retain, recruit, and empower employees.
- **Executive leadership:** meeting market growth requirements, environmental sustainability metrics.

## Sample outcomes by category

Speaking in business outcomes can feel like a foreign language to many technically minded individuals. To help ease translation, we curate a set of business outcome examples. You can use the following examples to inspire and demonstrate business outcomes that are based on actual transformation journeys.

To help you find business outcomes more easily, we've separated them into the following categories. This approach tends to drive consensus-building conversations across business units.

### Fiscal outcomes

Financial or fiscal performance is the cleanest business outcome for many business leaders, but not the only one.

### Agility outcomes

Today's fast-changing business environment places a premium on time. The ability to respond to and drive market change quickly is the fundamental measure of business agility.

<!-- docutune:ignore "global reach" -->

### Reach outcomes

In a constantly shrinking market, global reach (ability to support global customers and users) can be measured by compliance in geographies that are relevant to the business.

### Customer engagement outcomes

Social marketplaces are redefining winners and losers at an unheard-of pace. Responding to user needs is a key measure of customer engagement.

### Performance outcomes

Performance and reliability are assumed. When either falters, reputation damage can be painful and long-lasting.

Each of the business outcomes listed in the preceding categories can help facilitate a focused conversation among your business and technical team members. However, you shouldn't limit your conversations to these generic samples. Understanding the unique needs of your own business, and building outcomes that match, maximizes the value of a cloud transformation.

### Sustainability goals

More and more we are finding that organizations are starting to talk about environmental goals and sustainability targets.
