# Examples of performance outcomes

As discussed in [Business outcomes](./index.md), several potential business outcomes can serve as the foundation for any transformation journey conversation with the business. This article focuses on a common business measure: performance.

In today's technological society, customers assume that applications will perform well and always be available. When this expectation isn't met, it causes reputation damage that can be costly and long-lasting.

[GE Aviation's Digital Group](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/846315-ge-aviation-manufacturing-azure) deployed Microsoft Azure Digital Twins and other Azure resources to ingest and model data from multiple sources, building a complete digital aircraft view with built-in digital traceability of individual components that helps customers drive greater fuel efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and boost their fleets' flight-readiness.

## Performance

The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This provides several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, such as reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

Transform your business and reduce costs with an energy-efficient infrastructure that spans more than 100 highly secure facilities worldwide, linked by one of the largest networks on earth. Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider. This translates into the scale that's required to bring applications closer to users around the world, preserve data residency, and provide comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

- **Example 1:** A services company worked a hosting provider that hosted multiple operational infrastructure assets. Those systems suffered from frequent outages and poor performance. The company migrated its assets to Azure to take advantage of the SLA and performance controls of the cloud. Any downtime would cost the company approximately $15,000 USD per minute of outage. With between four and eight hours of outage per month, it was easy to justify this organizational transformation.

- **Example 2:** A consumer investment company was in the early stages of a cloud-enabled application innovation effort. Agile processes and DevOps were maturing well, but application performance was spiky. As a more mature transformation, the company started a program to monitor and automate sizing based on usage demands. The company eliminated sizing issues by using Azure performance management tools, resulting in a surprising 5 percent increase in transactions.

## Reliability

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive, because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider's network.

One of IT's crucial functions is ensuring that corporate data is never lost and applications stay available despite server crashes, power outages, or natural disasters. You can keep your data safe and recoverable by backing it up to Azure.

Azure Backup is a simple solution that decreases your infrastructure costs while providing enhanced security mechanisms to protect your data against ransomware. With one solution, you can protect workloads that are running in Azure and on-premises across Linux, Windows, VMware, and Hyper-V. You can ensure business continuity by keeping your applications running in Azure.

Azure Site Recovery makes it simple to test disaster recovery by replicating applications between Azure regions. You can also replicate on-premises VMware and Hyper-V virtual machines and physical servers to Azure to stay available if the primary site goes down. And you can recover workloads to the primary site when it's up and running again.

- **Example:** An oil and gas company used Azure technologies to implement a full site recovery. The company chose not to fully embrace the cloud for day-to-day operations, but the cloud's business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) features still protected their datacenter. As a hurricane formed hundreds of miles away, their implementation partner started recovering the site to Azure. Before the hurricane touched down, all mission-critical assets were running in Azure, preventing any downtime.
