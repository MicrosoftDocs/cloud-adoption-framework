# Understand technical considerations

When you're making the shift to the cloud, there are technical considerations around how it will help improve how you manage and maintain your cloud and workloads.
This guidance will help you discover the technical flexibility, efficiencies, and capabilities that aren't possible with your on-premises IT infrastructure and help you build a business case to migrate to the cloud.

## Technical benefits

### Scalability

Scalability, or the ability to scale out your resources depending on usage, utilization, and demand is one of the main technical benefits of moving to the cloud.

### Availability

On-premises, it's more costly to build highly available infrastructure. It's less costly to architect highly available infrastructure in the cloud.

### Security and compliance

When it comes to security and compliance, Microsoft is continually expanding our security infrastructure and toolsets to keep you on par with what's transpiring with respect to security threats on global networks.

### Capacity optimization

Capacity optimization, where you pay only for the resources you use over time, is another technical benefit of the cloud. The core concept to consider is how elasticity and on-demand resources help you deploy, provision, or deprovision resources more dynamically.

## Get the most out of your investment

### Achieve more with your investment

With a shift to the cloud, it's important to think differently about how you'll consume and manage your cloud resources. As you build your business case, it's critical to understand the key principles of cloud economics. When you plan short-term and long-term cloud solutions and align them to business outcomes, you can achieve more with every dollar you invest.

### Align your partner strategy

The Cloud Adoption Framework approaches cloud adoption as a self-service activity. The objective is to empower each of the teams supporting adoption through standardized approaches. In practice, you can't assume that a self-service approach will be sufficient for all adoption activities.

Successful cloud adoption programs typically involve at least one level of support. Some cloud adoption efforts may require support from multiple partners working together towards a common goal.
