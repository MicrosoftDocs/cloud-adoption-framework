# Suggested cloud adoption functions

For larger companies and enterprises, it's common to have a variety of teams and functions that are involved in the cloud adoption journey. These teams and functions are typically responsible for different aspects of the cloud adoption journey, and they work together to ensure that the cloud adoption projects are successful, from strategy to delivery.

- For _startups and smaller_ organizations, some of these functions might be combined or handled by a single team.
- For _enterprises and large_ organizations, these functions might be split into multiple teams or departments.
