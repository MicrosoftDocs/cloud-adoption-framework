# Suggested cloud adoption functions

For larger companies and enterprises, it's common to have a variety of teams and functions that are involved in the cloud adoption journey. These teams and functions are typically responsible for different aspects of the cloud adoption journey, and they work together to ensure that the cloud adoption projects are successful, from strategy to delivery.

- For _startups and smaller_ organizations, some of these functions might be combined or handled by a single team.
- For _enterprises and large_ organizations, these functions might be split into multiple teams or departments.

The following suggested cloud functions are based on the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. These functions are typically involved in a cloud adoption journey, but the specific functions and roles can vary depending on the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Some suggested functions might only be relevant in later stages of the cloud adoption journey. Come back to this list as you progress through the cloud adoption methodologies in the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## Cloud strategy functions

A cloud strategy team defines motivations and business outcomes for cloud adoption. This team is responsible for ensuring that the cloud adoption strategy is aligned with the business strategy and that the cloud adoption efforts are focused on achieving the desired business outcomes.

- Finance
- Line of business
- Human resources
- Operations
- Enterprise architecture

- Application groups
- Project managers

### Responsibilities

- _Primary focus_. Validate and maintain alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts.
