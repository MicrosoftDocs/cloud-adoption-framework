# Regulated Industries

Organizations in regulated industries, such as energy, finance, healthcare, or governments, have unique challenges and requirements for regulatory compliance.

It's important to inform your strategy about any specific requirements you have for your particular business.

**Recommendations:**

- *Determine regulatory requirements*: Document applicable regulatory requirements to the jurisdiction in which you operate.
- *Determine data access regulations*: Determine and document under what circumstances a cloud operator may access your data. For example, never, to fix issues you have with a given workload, to fix issues identified by the cloud operator, or no restrictions.
- *Determine the need for an exit strategy*: Determine how resilient you must be against geo-political events, and document the strategy on how you mitigate these events, which might include an exit strategy from a given cloud provider.
