# Financial efficiency considerations for your cloud strategy

Financial efficiency in your cloud adoption strategy means the effective management and optimization of costs that are associated with cloud service usage. Financial efficiency involves strategic decisions to help ensure that your organization gets the best value for your investment, while minimizing unnecessary expenses.

Cloud adoption helps drive business growth, expand market share, and increase revenue. Implement financial efficiency to help optimize your cloud adoption journey.

## Shift from CAPEX to OPEX

Traditionally, organizations have managed their IT budgets by using a Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) model. This approach requires a significant upfront investment in hardware and equipment. Organizations record that investment as an asset on the balance sheet.

But when you move to the cloud, IT spending shifts toward an Operating Expenses (OPEX), or revenue-based model. OPEX covers ongoing operational costs, such as periodic payments for services like Azure, where charges reflect actual usage and maintenance needs rather than fixed equipment costs. Use this model so that your organization can adjust costs based on actual usage, which promotes financial agility and efficiency. Other considerations included are:

- Review immediate tax deductions instead of depreciation that can improve your cash flow.

- Accounting changes.
- Changes in your maintenance contracts.
- You no longer do a one-time annual budget allocation. Taking advantage of cloud flexibility means you need to review constant changes in your budgets, which require combined efforts across IT and financial teams.

Regarding organizational relationships, an OPEX model enables cross-charge or continuously showing application costs to business departments. Consider a change to the commercial relationship between IT and application owners, and whether application running costs are funded centrally or through a chargeback or showback mechanism.

## Establish best practices with financial operations

To implement financial efficiency in cloud adoption, you must effectively manage and optimize cloud investments to ensure that they deliver maximum business value. During this process, you must:

- Gain a clear understanding of cloud usage and associated costs.
- Quantify the business value of cloud initiatives.
- Strategically optimize spending to align with organizational goals and avoid unnecessary expenditures.

Proper financial management plays a crucial role in this process. It helps prevent cost overruns, aligns spending with actual operational needs, and helps ensure that every dollar that you invest in the cloud directly contributes to achieving business objectives. Effective management safeguards against financial inefficiencies and reinforces strategic alignment across teams.

Embrace financial operations to cultivate a culture of financial responsibility that emphasizes accountability and data-driven decision making. Key capabilities empower this culture, such as accurate forecasting, strategic budgeting, and real-time cost tracking. Financial operations also encourage collaboration between finance, operations, and engineering teams to ensure shared ownership of cloud spending and outcomes.

Implement financial operations to find the right balance between innovation and cost effectiveness. Use this guidance to make cloud adoption a strategic advantage rather than a financial burden.

### Recommendations

Consider these financial efficiency considerations for your cloud adoption strategy.

- **Inform others about CAPEX to OPEX:** Inform your business teams and leadership. To ensure that your organization understands the new operating pricing models, discuss the shift from a traditional CAPEX cost structure to a more flexible OPEX pricing model. Discuss how the new model improves agility and efficiency. For more information, see [The shift from the CapEx to OpEx model](/training/modules/get-started-with-finops/1-introduction).

- **Implement budget management:** Establish budgets for the top-spending platform services on the cloud to control cloud costs in the initial stages of cloud adoption. This approach helps assist platform teams and budget managers detect unanticipated changes.
- **Maximize your return on investment:** Understand the cost-to-benefit ratio and ensure that the cloud services you plan to use directly contribute to business objectives. Explore the [Azure total cost of ownership calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator/), [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), and [Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management).
- **Explore the FinOps Framework:** Check out the [FinOps Framework](/cloud-computing/finops/) for best practices to maximize cloud business value.
- **Assess your financial posture:** Use the [FinOps Review assessment](/assessments/ad1c0f6b-396b-44a4-924b-7a4c778a13d3/) to get recommendations for maximizing cloud business value.
