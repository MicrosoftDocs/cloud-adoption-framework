# Financial efficiency

In your cloud adoption strategy, consider financial efficiency, which is the effective management and optimization of costs associated with the usage of cloud services. It also involves strategic decisions ensuring that the organization is getting the best value for its investment, while minimizing unnecessary expenses.

It's common to use the cloud to drive business growth, expand market share, and increase revenue. With financial efficiency in mind, you can optimize the adoption journey.

## Shift from CAPEX to OPEX

Traditionally, organizations have managed their IT budgets using a Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) model. In this approach, there is a significant upfront investment in hardware and equipment, which is then capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet.

However, moving to the cloud shifts IT spending toward an Operating Expenses (OPEX), or revenue-based model. OPEX covers ongoing operational costs, such as periodic payments for services like Azure, where charges reflect actual usage and maintenance needs rather than fixed equipment costs. This shift allows your organization to adjust costs based on actual usage, promoting financial agility and efficiency. Other considerations included are:

- Review immediate tax deductions instead of depreciation that can improve your cash flow.
- Accounting changes.
- Changes in your maintenance contracts.
- You'll no longer do a one-time annual budget allocation. Taking advantage of cloud flexibility means you need to review constant changes in your budgets, which require combined efforts across IT and financial teams.

Regarding organizational relationships, an OPEX model enables cross-charge or continuously showing application costs to business departments. Consider a change to the commercial relationship between IT and application owners, and whether application running costs are funded centrally or through a chargeback or showback mechanism.

## Establish best practices with FinOps

Financial efficiency in cloud adoption is about effectively managing and optimizing cloud investments to ensure they deliver maximum business value. This involves gaining a clear understanding of cloud usage and associated costs, quantifying the business value of cloud initiatives, and strategically optimizing spending to align with organizational goals while avoiding unnecessary expenditures.

Proper financial management plays a crucial role in this process. It helps prevent cost overruns, aligns spending with actual operational needs, and ensures that every dollar invested in the cloud directly contributes to achieving business objectives. Effective management not only safeguards against financial inefficiencies but also reinforces strategic alignment across teams.

By embracing FinOps, organizations can cultivate a culture of financial responsibility that emphasizes accountability and data-driven decision-making. This culture is empowered by key capabilities such as accurate forecasting, strategic budgeting, and real-time cost tracking. This also encourages collaboration between finance, operations, and engineering teams to ensure shared ownership of cloud spending and outcomes.

FinOps enables businesses to strike the right balance between innovation and cost-effectiveness, making cloud adoption a strategic advantage rather than a financial burden.

### Recommendations

Follow these recommendations to inform your cloud adoption strategy of financial efficiency considerations.

- *Inform about CAPEX to OPEX*: To ensure your organization understands the new operating pricing models, inform your business and leadership about the shift from a traditional CAPEX cost structure to a more flexible OPEX pricing model, allowing for more agility and efficiency. To learn more, see [The shift from CapEx to OpEx model](/training/modules/get-started-with-finops/1-introduction).  
- *Budget management*: Control cloud costs in the initial stages of cloud adoption by establishing budgets for the top-spending platform services on the cloud. This will help assist platform teams and budget managers detect unanticipated changes.
- *Maximize return on investment (ROI)*: Understand the cost-to-benefit ratio and ensure that the cloud services you plan to use directly contribute to business objectives. Start by exploring the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator/), [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), and [Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management).
- *Explore the FinOps Framework*: Check out the [FinOps Framework](/cloud-computing/finops/) for best practices to maximize cloud business value.
- *Assess financial posture*: Use the [FinOps Review assessment](/assessments/ad1c0f6b-396b-44a4-924b-7a4c778a13d3/) to get recommendations for maximizing cloud business value.
