# Sustainability considerations in your cloud strategy

Sustainability continues to gain importance as a performance indicator for organizations. As the sustainability transformation is making its mark on companies across industries, adding pressure from new types of stakeholders and challenging existing profit pools while creating opportunities to open new ones, companies are increasingly forced to respond effectively with new types of solutions and tech-enabled approaches.

This transformation is good for business. Research from multiple sources indicates that sustainability front runners have a lower cost-of-capital, deliver superior equity market returns, get easier access to new markets by creating new types of products and services, and/or are better at managing risk and ensuring more resilient operations.

> Did you know that transitioning workloads to Microsoft Azure can produce **up to 90%** more carbon efficiency and **up to 93%** more energy efficiency than on-premises options, depending on specific server usage, renewable energy purchases, and other factors.
> For more information, see [Microsoft's carbon benefits of cloud computing](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/3/9/739BC4AD-A855-436E-961D-9C95EB51DAF9/Microsoft_Cloud_Carbon_Study_2018.pdf) study.

Coming from a traditional on-premises data center, migrating to Azure can be up to [98% more carbon efficient](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/sustainability/#carbon-benefits). Microsoft has been leading in many of these areas and has been operating as carbon-neutral since 2012 and has made a commitment to be carbon-negative by 2030.

## Sustainability for your company's brand

There's a demand that customers, their executives and stakeholders, and their investors provide greater transparency into the environmental impact for the company from an operational point of view. Proactively working toward sustainability helps you establish a healthy brand for your company.

A sustainable business model can improve reputation, build trust and attract new talent/partners/investors. You can also see the benefits of sustainability as part of your business signature, combining your sustainability exercises with the ability to further communicate the reasoning behind your green journey.

Sustainability is critical to ensure long-term success as a player in the dynamic business space. Transforming the company towards a green model can also enable people's intrinsic motivation and attract new talent with an active interest in sustainability in the end.

## Infuse your strategy with sustainability

Consider some of the benefits of using the cloud in combination with and to drive your sustainability efforts:

- Meet regulatory compliance requirements.
- Support your organization to reduce carbon emissions using modern cloud tools.
- Use resources more efficiently.
- If you have net-zero commitments, you should learn about the opportunities to reduce your emissions using cloud infrastructure.
- Lessen your environmental footprint by migrating from on-premises to cloud data centers.
- Increase revenue by optimizing your technical landscape.
- Reduce operating costs by driving efficiency.
- Improve brand trust by driving sustainability and green IT practices.
- Get sustainability outcomes by combining financial efficiency and cost optimization, since cost optimization is often a proxy for an increased sustainability posture.

**Recommendations:**

- *Build green teams*: Establish goals and metrics for teams owning sustainability in your organization. Metrics can include greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint data, water use, and energy consumption. Consider gamification to pitch teams against each other to drive internal sustainability efforts.
- *Sustainability in the mission statement*: Consider adding sustainability and environmental responsibility to your mission statement, ensuring brand value alignment with the business activities and practices.
- *Understand your emissions by scope*: Evaluate your end-to-end supply chain to ensure [Scope 3 is also measured](/industry/sustainability/calculate-scope3), and read [Greenhouse gas emissions](https://microsoft.github.io/Sustainability-Resources/greenhouse-gas-emissions/) to gain insights into the contributors to your organizationâ€™s emissions.
- *Share sustainability reports*: Ensure transparency in your sustainability commitments and progress through publicly exposing annual sustainability reports. Read more in [Microsoft's 2021 Environmental Sustainability Report](https://www.microsoft.com/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report).
- *Track and control carbon emissions*: Use the [emissions impact dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard) to track carbon emissions. Reveal insights that can justify a data center migration.
- *Inform your workload teams*: Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework [Sustainability workload guidance](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/) to further enhance your workloads and reduce the environmental footprint.
- *Consider gamification*: Introducing gamification by creating a friendly culture of sustainability competition can help promote an active drive toward a more sustainable outcome. Track records to promote green initiatives and workloads, SCI scoring, and any optimization or improvement on the score.

## Azure-specific recommendations / or / Azure facilitation

> TBD Tobias note: Potentially convert this to a table and add before recommendations?

- *Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability*: Accelerate sustainability progress and business growth by bringing together a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities across the Microsoft cloud portfolio and with solutions from our global ecosystem of partners. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability?](/industry/sustainability/overview)
- *Microsoft Sustainability Manager*: Use the data intelligence and comprehensive, integrated and automated sustainability management capabilities with the [Microsoft Sustainability Manager](/industry/sustainability/sustainability-manager-overview).
- *Azure carbon optimization*: Measure and minimize the carbon impact of your Azure resources with [Azure carbon optimization](/azure/carbon-optimization/overview).
- *Emissions savings estimator for Microsoft Cloud*: Define your on-premises infrastructure workloads in this tool, then use the information to report your current on-premises footprint and comparable Azure footprint. See the [emissions savings estimator for Microsoft Cloud](https://gw.us-il301.gateway.prod.island.powerapps.com/customerenrollmentservice/estimator/index.html).
- *Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID)*: Evaluate your carbon emissions, and emissions you've already saved, related to using Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 cloud services. The [emissions impact dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard) helps you make targeted decisions.
