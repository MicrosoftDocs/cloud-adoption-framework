# Cost efficiency considerations for your cloud adoption strategy

Cost efficiency in your cloud adoption means that you effectively manage and optimize costs that are associated with cloud service usage. Cost efficiency involves strategic decisions to help ensure that your organization gets the best value for your investment and minimizes unnecessary expenses.

Cloud adoption helps drive business growth, expand market share, and increase revenue. Implement cost efficiency to help optimize your cloud adoption journey.

## Shift from a CapEx model to an OpEx model

Traditionally, organizations used a Capital Expenditures (CapEx) model to manage their IT budgets. This approach requires a significant upfront investment in hardware and equipment. Organizations record that investment as an asset on the balance sheet.

But when you move to the cloud, IT spending shifts toward an Operating Expenses (OpEx), or revenue-based, model. OpEx includes ongoing operational costs, such as periodic payments for services like Azure. The charges reflect actual usage and maintenance needs rather than fixed equipment costs. Use this model so that your organization can adjust costs based on actual usage, which promotes financial agility and efficiency.

Also consider the following factors when you shift to an OpEx model:

- **Immediate tax deductions:** To improve your cash flow, review immediate tax deductions instead of depreciation.
- **Accounting changes:** Be aware of any necessary changes in your accounting practices.
- **Maintenance contracts:** Review and adjust your maintenance contracts as needed.
- **Budget allocation:** Instead of a one-time annual budget allocation, take advantage of cloud flexibility by constantly reviewing and adjusting your budgets. This approach requires combined efforts across IT and financial teams.

You can use an OpEx model to allocate charges or provide real-time application costs to business departments. Also consider changes to the commercial relationship between IT and application owners. Determine whether you want to fund the cost to run applications centrally or through a chargeback or showback mechanism.

**Recommendations:**

Consider the following recommendations when shifting from a CapEx model to an OpEx model:

- _Inform others about CapEx to OpEx:_ Educate your business teams and leadership about the shift from a traditional CapEx cost structure to a more flexible OpEx pricing model. Discuss how the new model improves agility and efficiency. For more information, see [The shift from the CapEx to OpEx model](/training/modules/get-started-with-finops/1-introduction).

- _Implement budget management:_ Establish budgets for the top-spending platform services on the cloud to control cloud costs in the initial stages of cloud adoption. This approach helps platform teams and budget managers detect unanticipated changes.

- _Maximize your return on investment:_ Understand the cost-to-benefit ratio, and ensure that the cloud services you plan to use directly contribute to business objectives. Explore the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) and [Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management).

## Establish best practices with the FinOps framework

To implement cost efficiency in cloud adoption, you must effectively manage and optimize cloud investments to ensure that they deliver maximum business value. During this process, you must:

- Gain a clear understanding of cloud usage and associated costs.
- Quantify the business value of cloud initiatives.
- Optimize spending strategically to align with organizational goals and avoid unnecessary expenditures.

Proper financial management plays a crucial role in this process. It helps prevent cost overruns and align spending with actual operational needs. It also helps ensure that every dollar that you invest in the cloud directly contributes to achieving business objectives. Effective financial management safeguards against inefficiencies and reinforces strategic alignment across teams.

Embrace FinOps to cultivate a culture of financial responsibility that emphasizes accountability and data-driven decision making. Essential practices empower this culture, such as accurate forecasting, strategic budgeting, and real-time cost tracking. FinOps also encourage collaboration between finance, operations, and engineering teams to ensure shared ownership of cloud spending and outcomes.

Implement FinOps to find the right balance between innovation and cost effectiveness. A proper balance helps you make your cloud adoption a strategic advantage rather than a financial burden.

**Recommendations:**

Consider the following cost efficiency considerations for your cloud adoption strategy.

- _Explore the FinOps Framework:_ Check out the [FinOps Framework](/cloud-computing/finops/) for best practices to maximize cloud business value.

- _Assess your financial posture:_ Use the [FinOps Review assessment](/assessments/ad1c0f6b-396b-44a4-924b-7a4c778a13d3/) to get recommendations for maximizing cloud business value.
