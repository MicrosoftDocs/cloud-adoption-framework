# Artificial Intelligence

AI is revolutionizing cloud adoption strategies by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Integrate AI into your cloud platform to use advanced analytics, machine learning, and automation to optimize operations and drive business growth.

Building a robust strategy for your AI projects and initiatives into your cloud adoption strategy can help you accelerate innovation and secure the right leadership buy-in at the right altitude.

## Map your business requirements to applicable AI scenarios

Consider the importance of mapping AI to your business objectives. While there are many use cases for bringing AI into your business strategy, here are a few examples of benefits you might see:

- *Improved efficiency and agility*: Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing operational costs.
- *Enhanced decision-making*: Get data-driven insights to support more accurate and timely decisions.
- *Customer experience*: Get personalized interactions, improved satisfaction and loyalty.
- *Scalability and financial efficiency*: Expand your capabilities without proportional increases in cost.
- *Enable innovation*: Unlock new products, services, and business models.
- *Use your data*: Extract new value from your existing data.

> Tobias note: Potentially ensure that this list maps directly to the motivations+objectives+KR table, putting those examples to use.

**Recommendations:**

- *Evaluate AI for your business objectives*: Document where you can utilize generative and nongenerative AI capabilities to enhance the efficiency and outcomes of your desired business objectives.
- *Define an AI technology strategy*: Select the right tools and platforms for your AI use cases. Learn how to decide whether to buy or build your own AI solutions. For more information, see [Recommendations for organizations developing an AI adoption strategy](../../scenarios/ai/strategy.md).
- *Inform your organization and decision makers about adopting AI*: Dive into the [Cloud Adoption Framework guidance for adopting AI on Azure](../../scenarios/ai/index.md) – it will guide you through all the methodologies of the framework to teach you how to be successful with AI on Azure, and help you inform your cloud adoption strategy with the right considerations for AI.

## Assess your organizational AI readiness

Assess your organizational AI readiness to explore your team’s or organization's maturity level to develop, run, and maintain Azure AI solutions in production. Use the learnings from this self-service assessment to inform your strategy about gaps and recommended actions for your business.

> Tobias note: Add more information about the assessment and what results it yields.

**Recommendations:**

- *Assess your AI readiness*: Use the [Technical Assessment for Generative AI in Azure](/assessments/443670b4-11d1-4dd7-8128-b2bdb7a2bf2f/) to determine your current level of readiness for adopting generative AI and identify areas of improvement.

## Responsible and trusted AI

The six key principles for responsible AI at Microsoft include fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Use these principles to create responsible and trustworthy AI as you integrate it into mainstream products and services throughout your AI adoption journey.

### Responsible AI principles

Microsoft commits to [empowering responsible AI practices](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

Six key principles define responsible AI:

- *Fairness*: AI systems should treat everyone equally and provide the same recommendations to all individuals. Fairness in AI systems prevents discrimination based on personal characteristics.
- *Reliability and safety*: AI systems must operate reliably, safely, and consistently under various conditions to help build trust.
- *Privacy and security*: AI systems should respect privacy and maintain security by protecting private and confidential information. They should also resist attacks and attempts to corrupt or compromise the system.
- *Inclusiveness*: AI systems should empower and engage everyone. Inclusive design practices can help AI system developers understand and address potential exclusion barriers in a product or service. Inclusiveness fosters innovation and helps design experiences that benefit everyone.
- *Transparency*: AI systems should be transparent and understandable. AI systems can inform decisions that can deeply affect people's lives, so it's crucial for individuals to understand how the system makes these decisions.
- *Accountability*: AI systems and their developers should be accountable and answerable.

### The importance of responsible AI

As part of your adoption strategy, make sure you educate your leadership, decision makers, and the rest of your organization about the importance of responsible AI.

Incorporating responsible AI helps to mitigate the following risks:

- *Unintended consequences*: Plan and oversee your responsible AI implementation to reduce the risk of unforeseen effects that have ethical implications.
- *Evolving threats*: Novel threats emerge regularly as AI technology evolves. To help mitigate and stay ahead of these threats, adhere to the principles of responsible AI.
- *Bias*: Bias mitigation in AI can be challenging but is necessary to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased. Use the responsible AI principles to help guide you.
- *Sensitive technologies*: Technologies like facial recognition can be considered sensitive technology because of the risk to fundamental freedoms and human rights. Consider the implications of these technologies to ensure that you use them responsibly.

Incorporate responsible AI principles throughout your AI adoption journey, from strategy and planning to implementation. Ensure that you apply these principles when you secure, manage, and govern your AI initiatives.

**Recommendations for your strategy:**

Follow these recommendations to inform your cloud adoption strategy of AI considerations.

- *Responsible AI in your adoption AI adoption*: Incorporate ethical frameworks and regulatory practices into your AI implementation plan. To learn more, see [AI Plan - Recommendations for organizations planning AI adoption](../../scenarios/ai/plan.md#implement-responsible-ai).
- *Learn about the transparency notes for Azure services*: To understand the responsible use of Microsoft-related AI services, see how Microsoft promotes [responsible use of AI with Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/responsible-use-of-ai-overview). Use this information in your cloud adoption strategy so you can inform your stakeholders, partners and customers about the responsible adoption of AI technologies.
- *Explore Microsoft Azure AI Content Safety*: Discover how to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services and inform your strategy about these capabilities. For more information, see [Azure AI Content Safety documentation](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/).
- *Learn about inclusive AI design*: Use the [Inclusive AI design guidelines](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/InPursuitofInclusiveAI.pdf) to help you make informed decisions about designing AI that is inclusive and accessible to everyone.
