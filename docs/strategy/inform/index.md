> [!NOTE]

| Strategic consideration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Cost efficiency](./cost-efficiency.md) | Consider cost efficiency in your cloud adoption strategy. Cost efficiency measures how well you manage and optimize the costs that are associated with cloud service usage. To efficiently manage finances, you must make strategic decisions to help ensure that your organization gets the best value for its investment, while minimizing unnecessary expenses. |
| [AI](./ai.md) | AI is revolutionizing cloud adoption strategies by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Integrate AI into your cloud platform to use advanced analytics, machine learning, and automation to optimize operations and drive business growth. |
| [Resiliency](./resiliency.md) | Resiliency is the ability of your infrastructure to maintain functionality and availability despite disruptions or failures. Resiliency is a cornerstone of any successful cloud adoption strategy. Design your cloud infrastructure with resiliency in mind to minimize the effect of disruptions, which helps maintain continuity and reliability for your business operations. |
| [Security](./security.md) | You must have a well-designed security strategy for a successful cloud adoption. If your organization has traditional on-premises environments, you should evaluate your cloud expertise and specifically focus on cloud security. To manage security in the cloud, you might need to make significant changes to the structure of your security team and your overall security approach. |
| [Sustainability](./sustainability.md) | Sustainability continues to gain importance and influence companies across industries. This increasing focus on sustainability adds pressure from new types of stakeholders and challenges existing profit pools, while also creating opportunities for new profit avenues. Companies must respond effectively with innovative solutions and tech-enabled approaches. |
