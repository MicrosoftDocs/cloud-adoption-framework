# Cloud modernization strategies

Modernization is a business decision that seeks to maximize value for your business. You achieve this value by enhancing your technology and refining the process to support that technology.

By now, you should have a clear understanding of your modernization goals and the strategies you need to take to achieve those goals. We created a modernization roadmap in the [business alignment phase](../business-alignment/index.md) of the modernization framework. The roadmap will direct you to the modernization strategies that align with your modernization goals.

## Definition of modernization strategy

A modernization strategy is a modernization effort that targets a key component of your business technology. We defined modernization as enhancing your workloads and the process to support those workloads. A modernization strategy gives you concrete steps to modernize both your workload and supporting process.

## Modernization strategies

We scope modernization to just three different modernization strategies. These strategies provide the maximum value for your business with the least amount of effort.

- *Process modernization* - Adopt a DevOps methodology to modernize your development and operations. Process modernization is essential to lowering the total cost of ownership of your workloads.

- *Application modernization* - Adopt PaaS solutions to modernize any application or framework.

- *Database modernization* - Adopt database PaaS and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions to modernize any databases.

Process modernization is essential for getting the maximum value out of your modernization efforts. Start with process modernization first if you're not already using a DevOps methodology.
