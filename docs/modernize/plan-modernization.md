# Plan the modernization

Modernizing applications and systems in the cloud requires careful planning and governance. Without a structured plan, even well-intentioned modernization efforts can falter – leading to budget overruns, expanded scope, or service disruptions. A well-planned approach, on the other hand, reduces risk and aligns the technical work with business objectives. This guide provides prescriptive, logically ordered steps for organizations planning cloud modernizations, covering change management, scope control, phased execution, rollback planning, and stakeholder approval.

## Use a change management process

Treat the modernization initiative with the same rigor as you would any production system change. That means using formal processes to approve, track, and verify changes. The goal is to prevent unauthorized or low-quality changes from slipping in and to maintain stability throughout.

1. **Establish a formal change approval workflow.** Establish a workflow for approving changes related to the modernization. Depending on your organization, this could tie into an existing Change Advisory Board (CAB) or you could create a special review board for the project. Define who has authority to approve different types of changes. The key is that no change goes live without appropriate approval. Document this workflow in the project plan so everyone knows the procedure and authority for approvals. See [Manage change](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-change).

2. **Categorize change risks.** Not all changes are equal. Define risk levels (Low, Medium, High) for changes in the modernization project. Establish criteria for what falls into each bucket based risk. This prevents “big moves” from being made on a whim and ensures the scrutiny matches the risk. See [Manage change](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-change).

3. **Integrate automated quality checks.** Modernization often involves many iterative deployments. Embed quality checks into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically enforce policies before a change is applied to production. These gates act as automated gatekeepers, preventing human error from slipping through. They ensure each release meets your organization’s readiness criteria without manual intervention for routine checks. As an example, if a developer tries to deploy a service without an approval ticket, the pipeline should halt with a message like “Approval missing – deployment blocked.”

## Prevent modernization scope creep

One of the biggest threats to any project is the uncontrolled expansion of goals and tasks (scope creep). In a modernization project, scope creep can can turn a focused technical upgrade into a never-ending endeavor that tries to solve every problem or add new features along the way. To avoid this, be clear about the scope of your modernization and take steps to enforce those boundaries throughout the project.

1. **Create a modernization plan.** At the outset, write down exactly what should be modernized and how. This “modernization charter” should list the systems or components in scope and the specific improvement activities for each. For example:

 - In scope: “Inventory Service – replatform the database to Azure SQL and refactor API code for scalability.”
 - Out of scope: “Adding new end-user features to the Inventory application; UI redesign.”

Be as specific as possible. If the scope is “modernize the web application,” detail what that entails, such as containerizing the app and moving to Azure App Service, upgrading from .NET Framework to .NET 6. All stakeholders should agree on this scope document. This creates a single source of truth about the project deliverable.

2. **Exclude unrelated new features.** Make it policy that modernization projects not include developing new features unless absolutely necessary for the modernization. Be upfront about this rule with both business and IT teams. A helpful tactic is to maintain an “Out-of-Scope List” in your documentation. List potential ideas that are explicitly not being done now (“UI redesign – out of scope”). This removes ambiguity.

3. **Establish a formal change control process.** Despite best efforts, legitimate reasons to adjust scope can arise. A structured change control process ensures that scope additions receive proper evaluation rather than automatic inclusion in the current project. When stakeholders request new functionality during modernization, such as a new UI enhancement during backend modernization, document the request in a separate innovation backlog for future consideration. Use criteria such as "Does this change directly support the stated modernization goals?" and "Can this change be delivered without impacting the current timeline and budget?" to evaluate requests consistently.

4. **Keep everyone aligned on priorities.** Use your regular stakeholder updates to reinforce what the team is working on and what’s coming next, so there are no surprises. If someone tries to push a pet project into the mix, having transparent communications where progress is shown and the plan ahead is clear can help show there’s no slack for extra things right now.

5. **Document opportunities to build new features.** Modernization often sparks ideas for future improvements or features (because working closely with a system reveals opportunities). Instead of expanding the current project, maintain a separate list or backlog for these new functionality opportunities.

## Plan modernizations in phases

Modernization should not be a single big bang event. Attempting to do everything in one release is high risk and can lead to failure. Instead, break down the modernization into phases or iterations. A phased approach allows you to deliver incremental value, learn and adapt as you go, and reduce risk by tackling manageable chunks at a time.

1. **Divide the modernization into phases.** Look at your modernization scope and split the work along natural lines. Avoid trying to address everything in one go. Each phase should have a clear focus and deliverable. Define the exit criteria for each phase (for instance, “Phase 1 is done when X, Y, Z are modernized and running in production with performance within A% of target”). Also decide the number of phases upfront (at least roughly), but remain flexible to add a phase if needed. The example timeline above shows a common three-phase structure (but yours might have two or four based on complexity). The guiding principle: smallest chunks that deliver value and can be validated. Phased rollouts tend to have higher success rates and easier management than big bang deployments. Here are somne ways to divide modernization efforts:

    | Division Method         | Description                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                          |
    |-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | By component or layer   | Break down work based on system architecture layers or technical components.                                     | Phase 1 = database and infrastructure changes, Phase 2 = application code changes, Phase 3 = UI. |
    | By priority/risk        | Organize phases by complexity, risk, or impact.                                                                  | Phase 1 = low-risk quick wins, Phase 2 = complex/critical refactorings, Phase 3 = final tweaks. |
    | By business functionality | Divide work based on business domains or application boundaries.                                                | Modernize one application at a time in separate phases.                                          |

2. **Start with lower-risk modernizations.** Start with a modernization that is meaningful but not mission-critical. The goal is to build confidence in your plan and within your team/stakeholders without putting the business at major risk. For example, if you have an application with multiple services, perhaps modernize a background processing service or a read-only replica database first, instead of the main transactional database. Or migrate a dev/test environment to the cloud as a trial before production. Early success is motivating. Keep the earlier phases timeline short (weeks, not months). It’s like a pilot. If Phase 1 encounters issues, the impact is limited and you can course-correct.

3. **Plan subsequent phases by complexity and dependencies.** When you feel ready for more complex modernizations, prioritize the modernization efforts based on:

    - Business value: the parts of the system the business cares most about (customer-facing features, critical data).
    - Technical complexity: ensure you have the learnings and readiness to handle it.
    - Dependencies: if the new database needs the app code refactored to use it, those go in the same phase or sequential phases.

    Each phase should end in a working, deployable workload, even if partially modernized. This way you always deliver value and the system is better than it was.

4. **Define measurable success criteria for each phase.** Establish specific, time-bound targets that align with your strategy: "Reduce hosting costs by 20%" or "Improve response time by 40%." Track both technical metrics (performance, reliability, cost) and business metrics (user satisfaction, feature velocity) to validate value delivery and identify needed adjustments.

5. **Coordinate parallel work across teams.** If you have a number of teams, you can run some phases or tasks in parallel, provided they don’t conflict. For instance, one team could be working on setting up the new infrastructure while another team refactors code in a development branch. Don’t over-parallelize to the point that integration becomes a nightmare. Communication among teams is key if doing things in parallel.

6. **Validate thoroughly before advancing phases.** It’s much easier to pinpoint and resolve issues phase by phase than if everything changed at once. Treat the end of each phase as a milestone where you fully test the system as modified in that phase. This includes running all regression tests, performance tests, and even doing a security scan. Do not rush to the next phase without validating outcomes in production or a prod-like environment.

7. **Be willing to adjust the plan.** As you complete phases, you might discover that some planned work is no longer needed or new opportunities appear. That’s fine. The plan is not set in stone. Just ensure any changes to the plan still maintain the logic of phased risk management. Don’t suddenly decide on a big bang for the rest because the first phase was easy. Keep applying the iterative mindset

## Plan your deployment approach

You can use your existing environment and infrastructure to deploy

### Stand up a separate environment for complex modernizations

When a modernization involves high-risk changes, such as a component replatform, major code refactoring (schema changes), or anything that could significantly disrupt business operations> itt is often safest to use a completely separate environment to validate changes end-to-end. This approach goes hand-in-hand with the blue/green deployment pattern and the idea of thorough pre-production testing. If a change cannot be done in-place (for example, a new version is not backward compatible with the old, or it involves a new infrastructure paradigm), build it out in isolation. This might mean setting up a parallel production-like environment in the cloud for the new version. For example, if you're switching from a monolithic architecture to microservices or changing the underlying data storage engine, you'd spin up the new environment with those new components in place. This isolation prevents any instability or conflicts with the existing production (the “blue” environment).

### Update in-place when changes are simple

Simple code refactoring should be done in place. In-place updates, when done with careful planning, can minimize downtime and allow for rapid deployment cycles. They are especially useful for frequent minor improvements and are a staple of DevOps practices, but they rely on strong discipline in testing and monitoring to maintain safety.

Not all modernization actions require separate environments. Many changes, especially those that are low risk, can be done in-place on existing infrastructure with proper procedures. In-place updates allow faster iteration since you’re updating the system directly rather than maintaining two environments. However, even with in-place updates, you must take precautions to ensure safety

Ensure backward compatibility: When deploying changes on existing systems, the new version of the code or service should be able to handle data created by the old version and vice versa (at least until the update is fully rolled out).

Use feature flags and canary releases: Even in an in-place deployment, you can use the techniques of feature toggles and canaries to reduce risk. Feature flags allow you to push code into production but disable the new functionality by default. You can then enable it gradually for testing or for small user segments, controlling exposure. Similarly, if you are doing a rolling deployment, treat the first few updates as a canary by observing system behavior closely before proceeding to update everyone. In cloud environments like Azure or Kubernetes, you can often automate rolling deployments with health checks such that if a certain percentage of instances fail the new version, the deployment halts and rolls back automatically.

Automate health checks and observability: Set up continuous monitoring and health validation as part of your deployment pipeline. For example, incorporate health gates that automatically check the application’s heartbeat or run smoke tests immediately after deployment to each node. If a deployment causes increased error rates, slowed response, or other anomalies, automated systems should detect this quickly. Utilize telemetry and logging to watch key indicators (CPU, memory, error logs, user request latency, etc.). Define thresholds for these metrics that, if breached, will trigger an alert or an automated rollback. Having this observability in place ensures that if something goes wrong during an in-place update, you catch it early and can act (or the system can auto-revert) before it impacts all users.

## Define comprehensive rollback and recovery procedures

Even with the best planning and testing, not every change goes perfectly. Modernization often involves complex changes, and there’s always a risk that a deployment could introduce an issue, or something behaves unexpectedly in production. The mark of a well-prepared team is having a solid rollback plan for each change or phase.

1. **Document specific rollback procedures for each deployment type with step-by-step instructions.** For every major change or phase deliverable, write a step-by-step rollback procedure. This should be in your runbook or change plan document. Clearly list each action to undo the change, who is responsible for each step, and how long it would take. Including verification steps is crucial: after rollback, what checks will confirm things are back to normal?

2. **Automate rollbacks where possible.** Manual rollbacks can be slow and error-prone, especially at 3 AM during an outage. Automated rollback reduces recovery time and eliminates manual errors during high-pressure incident response. Use infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, ARM/Bicep) to re-deploy known good states or blue-green or canary deployments so you can switch back traffic to the source environment. Test rollback automation in staging environments to validate effectiveness and identify potential issues before production deployment. Write the rollback steps alongside the deployment steps, so it’s easy to rollback.

3. **Create a rollback monitoring plan.** If you ever have to perform a rollback, treat it like a deployment and monitor system health closely. Watch your dashboards (CPU, error rates, response times) to see if metrics are returning to normal ranges. If the rollback involves data, verify data consistency and maybe run queries to ensure records are correct. Have an external observer who is not performing steps but purely watching the effects.

## Secure stakeholder approval

With a solid plan in hand (scope defined, phases outlined, change and rollback processes ready), it’s time to get everyone on board. No modernization effort succeeds in a vacuum; you need support and buy-in from both technical teams and business leadership. Securing stakeholder approval isn’t just a one-time sign-off. It's about ongoing engagement and communication to ensure sustained support through the modernization journey.

1. **Communicate the vision and benefits.** A clear vision helps stakeholders understand the purpose and value of modernization. Tailor messaging to each audience. For technical teams, emphasize operational improvements such as reduced maintenance, improved reliability, and fewer emergency escalations. For business leaders, translate those improvements into business outcomes like faster time-to-market, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced operational costs. Use visuals and real-world examples to reinforce the message.

1. **Present a clear plan and timeline.** Stakeholders, especially management, want to see that this is a well-thought-out project, not an open-ended sink. A structured plan builds confidence and reduces uncertainty. Share a high-level roadmap that outlines workloads, migration phases, and estimated timelines. Include quick wins and phase deliverables to demonstrate early value. Use tools like Azure Migrate to assess workloads and define migration waves. Document dependencies and resource needs to support planning accuracy.

1. **Create a data-driven ROI analysis.** Present a clear financial case that connects modernization costs to business value. Use specific numbers and timeframes in your analysis. For example: "A $500,000 investment reduces annual operating costs by $300,000 and prevents $1M in hardware upgrades, achieving ROI in 18 months." Use common examples:

    | Cost/Benefit category | Description | Value |
    |----------------------|-------------|---------|
    | Direct Costs | Azure infrastructure, engineering hours, licenses, consulting fees | Upfront investment costs |
    | Measurable Benefits | Infrastructure costs, maintenance needs, automation efficiency | Operational savings |
    | Business Impacts | Revenue from faster deployments, prevented outage costs | Direct business value |
    | ROI Timeline | Investment breakeven analysis | 12-24 month typical return |
    | Risk Costs | System failures, security incidents | Cost avoidance metrics |
    | Resource Reallocation | Maintenance to innovation shift | Team productivity gains |

1. **Address risks openly.** Be frank about the challenges and how you’ll handle them. Every stakeholder knows no project is without risk. By bringing them up proactively, you demonstrate competence and honesty. Identify risks such as data migration issues, performance tuning needs, and integration challenges. Provide mitigation strategies like fallback procedures, testing protocols, and expert consultations. Include a one-page project charter with a dedicated risk section. Stakeholders appreciate transparency. It builds trust that you aren’t naive to potential problems and that you have plans in place.

1. **Maintain ongoing stakeholder engagement.** Don’t treat approval as a one-and-done. Maintain regular status updates (monthly steering committee meetings, or brief weekly emails to key folks), highlight achievements, next steps, and any help needed. Demonstrate wins as they come. Solicit feedback and keep an ear open for concerns.
