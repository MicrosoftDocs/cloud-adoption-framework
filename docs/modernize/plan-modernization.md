# Plan the modernization

A well-structured plan reduces risk and ensures your modernization aligns with cloud design principles. You should define the scope, prioritize workloads, and choose the right modernization techniques (whether replatforming to PaaS services, refactoring code to address technical debt, or rearchitecting for cloud-native advantages). Start by assessing your current systems and identifying which applications or components would benefit most from modernization. Then develop a plan as follows:

## Identify what to modernize

Use the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/pillars) and [cloud design patterns](/azure/architecture/patterns/#pattern-catalog) to guide decisions. Evaluate downtime tolerance, performance needs, and compliance requirements. Ensure code and service changes align with proven best practices. For every new service in your architecture, review its [Azure service guides] to align each service to best practices. 3. **Use Azure Well-Architected Framework for technical assessment.** The Azure Well-Architected Framework provides systematic evaluation across reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency pillars. You should conduct Well-Architected Reviews to assess existing workloads against these pillars and identify those demonstrating significant gaps as primary modernization candidates.

## Use a change management process

Modernization should be governed by a formal change management process that aligns with your organization’s governance and risk tolerance. This ensures that all changes follow organizational policies and minimize disruption. Key elements include:

1. **Establish a formal change approval workflow.** This process prevents unauthorized changes and establishes decision-making authority for different types of modernization activities. You should define who approves specific changes based on their scope and impact—for example, architectural reviewers for major refactoring decisions or management approval for changes that affect user experience. Use tools like Azure DevOps or ServiceNow to automate approval tracking and maintain an audit trail of all change decisions.

2. **Define risk thresholds and escalation paths that categorize changes by potential impact.** Risk categorization helps balance deployment speed with risk management by applying appropriate scrutiny to each change type. This approach ensures that low-risk changes move quickly while high-risk changes receive adequate review. You should establish clear categories (low, medium, high) based on criteria such as downtime tolerance, workload criticality, and potential business impact. For instance, configuration updates might require only peer review, while architectural changes need governance board approval. Document specific escalation criteria so teams know when to involve senior stakeholders or additional reviewers.

3. **Implement deployment gates that enforce compliance and quality standards through automated checks.** Deployment gates integrate into CI/CD pipelines to validate that changes meet organizational policies before deployment. These automated controls reduce manual errors and ensure consistent quality standards across all releases. You should configure gates to run all required tests, validate security scans, verify documentation completeness, and confirm that necessary approvals are in place. This automation ensures that every release meets your organization's readiness criteria without requiring manual intervention for routine checks.

## Prevent modernization scope creep

A clearly defined scope maintains focus on technical improvements rather than feature expansion. This clarity reduces risk and prevents delivery delays. You should establish boundaries for the modernization project, select the appropriate modernization strategy, and manage new feature requests separately to ensure project success.

1. **Create a modernization plan.** Document the modernization scope in a brief charter or plan. List the systems or components that will be modernized and state the specific technical goals. For example: “Modernize the Inventory Service by replatforming its database to a managed cloud DB and refactoring the API code for better scalability.” Make sure all stakeholders agree on this document to prevent misalignment later. The charter provides a reference to say “this is what we’re doing.”

2. **Exclude unrelated new features.** Commit to not adding product features or enhancements that are not required for the modernization. Modernization is about improving the internals (or infrastructure) of what you already have. If during the project someone says, “Could we also add a new user dashboard since we’re working on this app anyway?”, that’s a red flag for scope creep. Politely defer such requests. Unless a new feature is critical to enable the modernized system to run, do not include it. This discipline keeps the project from growing uncontrollably. It’s often helpful to explicitly list out-of-scope items (“UI redesign is not in scope”).

3. **Establish a formal change control process.** A structured change control process ensures that scope additions receive proper evaluation rather than automatic inclusion in the current project. When stakeholders request new functionality during modernization, such as a new UI enhancement during backend modernization, document the request in a separate innovation backlog for future consideration. Use criteria such as "Does this change directly support the stated modernization goals?" and "Can this change be delivered without impacting the current timeline and budget?" to evaluate requests consistently.

4. **Document opportunities to build new features.** Modernization often sparks ideas for future improvements or features (because working closely with a system reveals opportunities). Instead of expanding the current project, maintain a separate list or backlog for these new functionality opportunities.

## Plan modernization

Instead of attempting the entire modernization in one massive effort, break your selected modernization strategy into phases or iterations. A phased approach reduces risk, allows the team to learn and adapt continuously, and sequences activities based on the complexity and interdependencies of your chosen strategy. Here's how to implement phased modernization:

1. **Analyze system architecture to identify discrete components for independent modernization.** System decomposition enables parallel team efforts and prevents single-point-of-failure scenarios during modernization. You should map your application or infrastructure into logical boundaries such as database layers, backend services, frontend components, or specific microservices within monolithic applications. This analysis allows different teams to work concurrently on separate components while maintaining clear integration points. Document dependencies between components to understand the impact of changes and plan the sequence of modernization activities based on your selected strategy—for example, prioritizing data replatforming before application refactoring or establishing API foundations before microservices rearchitecting.

2. **Sequence phases based on your modernization strategy and component complexity.** Phase sequencing should align with your chosen modernization approach and build confidence through progressive complexity. For replatforming strategies, start with infrastructure components like databases and hosting platforms to establish cloud foundations, then move application components with minimal code changes. For refactoring strategies, begin with components that have clear boundaries and limited dependencies, such as utility services or data access layers, before tackling core business logic. For rearchitecting strategies, establish new architectural patterns with pilot components before migrating critical business functions, allowing teams to validate approaches and build expertise progressively.

3. **Define measurable success criteria and performance metrics for each modernization phase.** Clear objectives and quantifiable metrics enable stakeholder confidence and demonstrate progress throughout the modernization journey. You should establish specific, time-bound targets for each phase that align with your modernization strategy, such as "Phase 1: Reduce hosting costs by 20% through database replatforming" or "Phase 2: Improve application response time by 40% through service refactoring" or "Phase 3: Enable 10x traffic scaling through microservices rearchitecting." Track both technical metrics (performance, reliability, cost) and business metrics (user satisfaction, feature velocity) to validate that modernization activities deliver expected value. Regular assessment against these goals provides data-driven evidence for continuing investment and helps identify areas requiring adjustment.

4. **Implement comprehensive validation and stability verification before phase progression.** Phase-gate validation prevents cascading issues and ensures each modernization step provides a stable foundation for subsequent activities. You should execute complete test suites including unit tests, integration tests, performance validation, and user acceptance testing for each modernized component. Monitor production systems closely using Azure Monitor or equivalent observability tools to detect anomalies in system behavior, performance degradation, or error rate increases. Establish specific stability criteria such as maintaining 99.9% uptime for 30 days or keeping error rates below baseline thresholds before advancing to the next phase.

5. **Plan iterative learning cycles to inform subsequent modernization phases.** Early modernization experiences provide valuable insights that optimize later phase planning and execution strategies. You should conduct retrospective analyses after each phase to capture lessons learned, identify process improvements, and validate technical approaches. Document successful patterns and anti-patterns discovered during implementation to guide future component modernization. Use insights from early phases to refine approaches for more complex changes—for example, discovering that certain refactored components could benefit from serverless rearchitecting in later phases rather than intermediate containerization steps, or finding that API-first patterns established during refactoring enable faster microservices decomposition during rearchitecting phases.

## Select deployment patterns and rollback strategies

Deployment strategy selection determines the risk level and business impact of each modernization release. The strategy should align with the change characteristics—risk level, complexity, and backward compatibility. Integration of deployment strategy into modernization planning reduces deployment failures and accelerates recovery when issues occur.

1. **Use in-place rolling updates for backward-compatible changes with minimal business risk.** Rolling updates provide the fastest deployment approach for changes that maintain interface compatibility and data schema consistency. This approach gradually replaces application instances one at a time while maintaining service availability, such as updating individual servers or Kubernetes pods sequentially. Monitor health checks continuously during rolling updates and configure automated rollback triggers when instance failures occur to prevent widespread system impact.

2. **Deploy major changes through blue-green environments to isolate risk and enable rapid rollback.** Blue-green deployments eliminate downtime risk for high-impact changes by maintaining parallel production environments. Deploy updated components to the green environment while blue continues serving production traffic, then validate the green environment through comprehensive testing including integration tests, performance validation, and security compliance checks. Switch traffic to green only after stakeholder approval and maintain blue as an immediate fallback option until the deployment proves stable.

3. **Implement progressive exposure techniques to validate changes under real production conditions.** Canary releases reduce deployment risk by exposing changes to limited user subsets before full rollout, enabling early detection of issues through real-world validation. Route a small percentage of traffic (typically 5-10%) to the new version initially, monitor key metrics including error rates and response times, then gradually increase exposure based on performance validation. Use feature flags to enable dark launches where new functionality runs invisibly alongside existing systems, allowing performance testing without user impact.

4. **Apply the strangler fig pattern for architectural modernizations involving monolith decomposition.** The strangler fig approach enables incremental replacement of legacy system components while maintaining operational continuity. Implement a facade or API gateway to route requests between legacy monoliths and new microservices, gradually migrating functionality by redirecting specific features to modernized services while preserving the ability to route traffic back to the monolith if issues arise.

5. **Establish automated rollback procedures with predefined trigger conditions.** Automated rollback capabilities minimize recovery time and reduce manual intervention during incident response. Define specific conditions that trigger automatic rollback such as error rate thresholds, performance degradation metrics, or user impact indicators (for example, error rates exceeding 2% or response times increasing by 50%). Implement rollback automation through CI/CD pipelines and maintain database rollback strategies using techniques like expand-and-contract schema changes to ensure data compatibility during reversions.

6. **Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability throughout deployment processes.** Continuous monitoring enables early detection of deployment issues and provides data-driven rollback decisions. Configure monitoring for both technical metrics (system performance, error rates, resource utilization) and business metrics (user experience, transaction success rates) during deployments. Establish monitoring dashboards that provide real-time visibility into deployment health and configure alerts that notify operations teams when intervention becomes necessary.

## Define comprehensive rollback and recovery procedures

Every modernization phase requires documented rollback procedures that enable rapid recovery from deployment issues. Rollback planning reduces incident resolution time and maintains system stability during modernization activities.

1. **Document specific rollback procedures for each deployment type with step-by-step instructions.** Detailed rollback documentation eliminates decision-making delays during incidents and ensures consistent recovery procedures across team members. Create runbooks that specify exact steps for reversing each type of change, including traffic redirection procedures for blue-green deployments, version rollback commands for rolling deployments, and database restoration processes for data-related changes. Include verification steps to confirm successful rollback completion and system stability restoration.

2. **Automate rollback processes through infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipeline integration.** Automated rollback reduces recovery time and eliminates manual errors during high-pressure incident response. Implement rollback automation using the same tools used for deployment, such as maintaining Kubernetes manifests for previous versions or Azure DevOps release pipelines configured for automated reversion. Test rollback automation in staging environments to validate effectiveness and identify potential issues before production deployment.

3. **Conduct regular rollback drills to validate procedures and team readiness.** Rollback drills ensure team proficiency and identify procedure gaps before actual incidents occur. Schedule quarterly "game day" exercises where teams practice executing rollback procedures for simulated failures, including database corruption scenarios, application failures, and performance degradation events. Document lessons learned from drills and update rollback procedures based on discovered issues or process improvements.

4. **Monitor system health during rollback execution to ensure successful recovery.** Rollback monitoring validates that recovery actions restore expected system behavior and identifies any cascading effects from the reversion. Implement monitoring that tracks both the rollback process progress and system health indicators during recovery, ensuring that rollback actions achieve their intended outcomes. Establish post-rollback validation procedures that confirm system stability and user experience restoration before declaring incident resolution.
