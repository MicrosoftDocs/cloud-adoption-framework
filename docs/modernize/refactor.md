Operational Excellence
Update developer frameworks to use Azure SDKs
- 5. **Modernize Azure operations.** Infrastructure-as-code and DevOps practices provide standardized, repeatable approaches to infrastructure management. Modern operations enable faster, safer changes and support innovation by allowing teams to quickly create replica test environments. You should adopt infrastructure-as-code to standardize operations and improve deployment consistency. Use Azure Verified Modules. These modules provide pre-tested, standardized infrastructure templates that follow Azure best practices. Azure Verified Modules reduce development time and ensure consistent deployments across environments. Integrate AI-powered development tools. Use GitHub Copilot and Azure Copilot to accelerate code generation and provide intelligent suggestions for infrastructure configurations. These tools help reduce manual coding effort and improve code quality. Establish CI/CD pipelines. Create automated deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to ensure consistent, reliable deployments across all environments.
