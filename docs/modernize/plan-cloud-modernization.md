# Plan your cloud modernization

Modernizing applications and workloads in the cloud requires careful planning and governance. Without a structured plan, even well-intentioned modernization efforts can falter, leading to budget overruns, expanded scope, or service disruptions. A well-planned approach, on the other hand, reduces risk and aligns the technical work with business objectives.

## Choose a modernization strategy

There are multiple ways to modernize a workload, ranging from light optimizations to deep redesign. The three primary strategies are replatform, refactor, and rearchitect. It’s common to even use a combination on a single system (for example, replatform the database and refactor some code). The key is to choose the right approach for each component based on your goals, timeline, and resources.

    | Modernization strategy | Description | When to use | Pros | Cons |
    |----------|-------------|-------------|------|------|
    | **Replatform** | Shift workloads to managed cloud services with minimal code changes for immediate gains | Need fast wins with minimal disruption | Fast to implement; reduces maintenance as managed services handle more operations; improves reliability without code overhaul | Limited upside as core application remains the same; won't get new capabilities or major performance gains beyond what the new platform provides |
    | **Refactor** | Optimize the code without changing its purpose by cleaning, reorganizing, and improving existing code to reduce technical debt | Technical debt slows delivery or causes issues | Improves maintainability, performance, and security of code; enables easier future enhancements | Requires code-level work and thorough testing; users typically see no immediate new features as improvements are mostly behind-the-scenes |
    | **Rearchitect** | Redesign for cloud-native capabilities by fundamentally changing the architecture (break monolith into microservices, adopt serverless patterns) | Current design limits scale or innovation and you need to unlock new cloud benefits | Addresses scalability and agility at the root; enables new features and cloud services with major long-term benefits | Most complex and time-consuming approach; essentially rebuilds significant parts of the system, which demands advanced skills and careful planning to avoid disruption |

## Plan modernizations in phases

1. **Divide modernizations into logical phases.** Don’t try to modernize everything in one go. Breaking the effort into phases is a best practice to reduce risk and deliver incremental value. Each phase should have clear goals and deliverables. The idea is to create manageable chunks of work that can be completed and validated one at a time. You can divide phases in different ways:

    | Division method | Description | Example |
    |-----------------|-------------|---------|
    | By component or layer | Separate phases based on workload layers or system boundaries | Phase 1: Database migration, Phase 2: Application refactoring, Phase 3: UI modernization |
    | By priority and complexity | Organize work from low-risk to high-risk changes | Phase 1: Noncritical services, Phase 2: Core business logic, Phase 3: Customer-facing features |
    | By business function | Structure phases around application or functional boundaries | Phase 1: User management system, Phase 2: Payment processing, Phase 3: Reporting services |

2. **Start with low-risk, high-value changes.** Kick off with a phase that is achievable and delivers a tangible win, but does not put your most critical systems at risk. For instance, modernize a backend service or internal tool first rather than the customer-facing website. Aim to complete the first phase relatively quickly (a month or two) as a proof-point. Early success builds team confidence and stakeholder support for subsequent phases.

3. **Sequence remaining phases by value and dependencies.** Plan the order of phases so that prerequisites are handled first. If one app depends on another, modernize the dependency first. If certain foundational work is needed, make that Phase 0 or 1 before you dive into application changes. Also, handle any stabilization needed as a preliminary step. For example, if a system is too unstable to modernize, phase 0 might be to fix its stability under the current state.

4. **Define success criteria for each phase.** Define specific, time-bound targets for each phase, such as "Phase 1 is done when Service X is running on Azure App Service with no open high-severity bugs and performance is within 10% of baseline." When a phase meets its goals, you move to the next. Success criteria helps prevent scope creep.

5. **Adapt plans based on results.** After completing a phase, review results and lessons learned. You might find that some assumptions were off or some tasks were easier or harder than expected. Adjust the plan for upcoming phases accordingly, such as adding, combining, or re-prioritizing phases The phased approach is meant to be flexible. What’s important is not to try doing everything at once.

## Plan for modernization governance

1. **Establish a formal change approval workflow.** Define a structured approval process for all modernization-related changes. Integrate with existing Change Advisory Boards (CAB) or create a dedicated modernization review board. Assign approval authority based on change category and document the full workflow in your project plan. For more information, see [Manage change](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-change).

2. **Freeze changes when necessary.** As you approach a big deployment (say the go-live of a modernization phase), implement a code freeze or change freeze on the systems involved. This means no other unrelated changes are done to those systems in the lead-up and during the deployment. It stabilizes the environment so you’re not hitting a moving target. Communicate the freeze window to all relevant teams (“No changes to Production environment from Friday 00:00 to Sunday 00:00 while we deploy modernization updates”).

3. **Avoid scope creep.** Scope creep is a major challenge in modernizations. Require that any proposed scope changes (extra work not in the original modernization plan) go through evaluation and approval. Most requests should be deferred unless they are crucial. Keep a log of any requests for new features as later [cloud-native development](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/) opportunities. Formalize the “no, not now” to extra work with a process, so stakeholders know their idea isn’t lost and it won’t derail the current modernization without proper justification.

## Define your deployment strategy

A crucial execution decision is how to roll out the modernized components into production. The two broad strategies are in-place deployment (update in the existing environment) and parallel deployment (build a new environment alongside). Each has trade-offs:

1. **Use in-place deployment for low-risk, reversible changes.** In-place deployment introduces changes directly into the current production environment, perhaps during a maintenance window. This strategy minimizes infrastructure overhead but increases the risk of downtime. Use in-place deployment only when changes are small, isolated, and easily reversible. Examples include minor code updates or schema changes that can be rolled back quickly using source control or backups.

2. **Use parallel deployment for complex or high-risk changes.** In this model, you set up a new environment for the modernized system while the old system still runs. Data is kept in sync (through replication or migration processes) so that when ready, you can cut over from the old to the new environment. Use for complex or high-risk changes where downtime must be minimal. If you’re doing a major database migration or a rearchitecting that involves new infrastructure, parallel is usually the way. Also, if the system is mission-critical and can’t have more than a few minutes of downtime, parallel (with replication and quick cutover) is necessary.

    | Strategy | Description | When to use | Pros | Cons |
    |----------|-------------|-------------|------|------|
    | **In-place deployment** | Deploy changes directly into current production environment | Small, reversible changes with acceptable maintenance windows | No duplicate infrastructure, faster deployment | Higher risk, requires downtime, slower rollback |
    | **Parallel deployment** | Run new environment alongside existing system during transition | Complex changes, mission-critical systems requiring minimal downtime | Safer deployment, near-zero downtime, immediate fallback | Duplicate infrastructure costs, complex data sync, additional decommission effort |

## Plan to mitigate modernization risks

Even with the best planning and testing, not every change goes perfectly. Modernization often involves complex changes, and there’s always a risk that a deployment could introduce an issue, or something behaves unexpectedly in production. The mark of a well-prepared team is having a solid rollback plan for each change or phase.

1. **Use progressive deployment techniques.** If the platform allows, do canary releases or gradual traffic shifting to modernized portions of the app. For example, deploy the new version alongside the old and initially send only 5% of users to it while monitoring. This can catch issues while most users are unaffected. If metrics look good, increase to 50%, then 100%. If something starts failing, route back to 0% new (rollback) quickly.

2. **Create rollback procedures for every major change.** For every major change or phase deliverable, write a step-by-step rollback procedure. Clearly list each action to undo the change, who is responsible for each step, and how long it would take. After rollback, include what checks confirm things are back to normal.

3. **Automate rollbacks where possible.** Automated rollback scripts or infrastructure-as-code can make recovery fast and reliable. Use infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, ARM, Bicep) to redeploy known good states. Blue-green or canary deployments inherently allow “switching back” to the previous version if needed. Test these mechanisms in staging. The goal is to reduce manual effort (at 3 AM during an incident) to a scripted action. Write the rollback steps alongside the deployment steps, so it’s easy to roll back.

4. **Have support on hand.** Plan deployments during low-traffic periods (weekends or overnight) when possible, but ensure the relevant experts are available. Don’t do it when key team members are on vacation. Have an extended support (hypercare) period right after deployment with developers and operations on standby to catch any issues early. For major go-lives, some organizations have war-room style monitoring for 24-48 hours after.

## Secure stakeholder approval

Stakeholder alignment is the cornerstone of a successful modernization initiative. Gaining approval requires more than just a technical plan. It demands a compelling business case, transparent risk management, and consistent engagement throughout the project lifecycle.

1. **Tailor the value proposition.** Different stakeholders care about different outcomes. Customize your messaging:

    - **Technical teams** prioritize operational efficiency: reduced maintenance, improved uptime, and fewer escalations.
    - **Business leaders** focus on outcomes: faster time-to-market, improved customer experience, and cost savings.

2. **Document a structured plan with measurable deliverables.** Create a high-level roadmap that shows specific workloads, migration phases, and realistic timelines. Include early wins within the first 4-6 weeks to demonstrate progress and validate the approach.

3. **Quantify modernization value.** Link modernization investment to measurable outcomes. Use a simple ROI table to communicate impact:

    | Category | Example Metrics | Typical Value Range |
    |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
    | Cost reduction | Infrastructure, maintenance, licensing | 20-40% annual savings |
    | Productivity gains | Deployment frequency, resolution time | 50-80% improvement |
    | Risk mitigation | Avoided downtime, security incidents | $100K-$ 1M+ cost avoidance |
    | Revenue | Faster time-to-market, customer retention | 10-25% revenue acceleration |

4. **Address project risks.** Identify potential challenges and demonstrate preparedness through specific mitigation strategies. Common risks include data replication, performance degradation, and integration issues. Present solutions such as automated rollback procedures, comprehensive testing protocols, and expert consultation availability. Transparent risk discussion builds stakeholder confidence in project leadership and planning thoroughness.

5. **Maintain regular communication cadence.** Report progress against defined success criteria, highlight completed deliverables, and communicate upcoming milestones. Request feedback actively and address concerns to maintain support throughout the modernization process.
