# Plan your cloud modernization

Modernizing applications and workloads in the cloud requires careful planning and governance. Without a structured plan, even well-intentioned modernization efforts can falter – leading to budget overruns, expanded scope, or service disruptions. A well-planned approach, on the other hand, reduces risk and aligns the technical work with business objectives. This guide provides prescriptive, logically ordered steps for organizations planning cloud modernizations, covering change management, scope control, phased execution, rollback planning, and stakeholder approval.

## Use a change management process

Modernization initiatives require the same formal oversight processes as production workload changes. Change management ensures that only approved, quality changes advance to production while maintaining system stability throughout the modernization effort.

1. **Establish a formal change approval workflow.** Create a structured approval process for all modernization-related changes. Organizations can integrate this workflow with existing Change Advisory Boards (CAB) or establish a dedicated modernization review board. Define approval authority levels for different change categories to ensure appropriate oversight. Document the complete workflow in your project plan, specifying procedures and approval authorities for all stakeholders. Reference [Manage change](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-change) for detailed implementation guidance.

2. **Categorize changes by risk level.** Classify all modernization changes using defined risk categories: Low, Medium, and High. Establish specific criteria for each risk level based on potential business impact, technical complexity, and rollback difficulty. This classification system ensures that high-impact changes receive appropriate scrutiny while streamlining approval for routine updates. Risk-based categorization prevents impulsive decisions on critical changes and aligns review processes with actual project risks. Reference [Manage change](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/administer#manage-change) for risk assessment frameworks.

3. **Implement automated quality gates.** Embed automated quality checks directly into CI/CD pipelines to enforce approval policies before production deployment. These automated gates validate that each change meets organizational readiness criteria without requiring manual intervention for routine checks. Configure pipeline rules to block deployments that lack proper approvals, with clear error messages such as "Approval ticket required – deployment blocked." Automated quality gates reduce human error and ensure consistent policy enforcement across all modernization releases.

## Prevent modernization scope creep

Modernization projects face constant pressure to expand beyond their original goals. Scope creep transforms focused technical upgrades into endless projects that attempt to solve every problem simultaneously. Clear boundaries and enforcement mechanisms prevent this expansion and keep projects on track.

1. **Document specific modernization scope.** Create a written modernization charter that defines exactly which workloads require modernization and the specific activities for each component. Include concrete examples for each workload:

    - **In scope:** "Inventory Service – migrate database to Azure SQL Database and refactor API code for cloud scalability"
    - **Out of scope:** "New inventory features, UI redesign, or workflow changes"

    Specify technical activities such as "containerize application and deploy to Azure Container Apps" or "upgrade from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 8" to eliminate ambiguity. Secure stakeholder agreement on this scope document before work begins to establish a single source of truth for project deliverables.

2. **Exclude new feature development.** Establish a clear policy that modernization projects focus solely on technical improvements, not new business functionality. Communicate this rule explicitly to business and technical teams at project kickoff. Maintain a documented "Out-of-Scope List" that includes potential ideas like "mobile application development – out of scope for current project" to prevent recurring discussions about excluded items.

3. **Control scope changes through formal evaluation.** Create a structured process for evaluating legitimate scope change requests that arise during modernization. When stakeholders request additions such as new user interface features during backend modernization, document these requests in a separate innovation backlog for future consideration. Apply consistent evaluation criteria: "Does this change directly support stated modernization objectives?" and "Can this addition be completed without affecting current timeline and budget?" Only approve changes that meet both criteria and provide clear business justification.

4. **Communicate project focus consistently.** Use regular stakeholder updates to reinforce current work and upcoming activities, preventing scope expansion through transparent progress reporting. When stakeholders propose additional work, reference the agreed-upon scope document and timeline to demonstrate capacity constraints. Clear communication about planned activities helps stakeholders understand that additional requests require separate project planning.

5. **Capture future opportunities separately.** Modernization work often reveals opportunities for business improvements or new capabilities. Instead of expanding the current project scope, maintain a dedicated backlog for these future enhancement ideas. This approach acknowledges valuable suggestions while protecting the current project timeline and ensures good ideas receive proper planning and resource allocation in future initiatives.

## Plan modernizations in phases

Applications evolve through structured phases rather than single large deployments. Phased modernization reduces risk, delivers incremental value, and enables teams to learn and adapt throughout the process.

1. **Divide work into distinct phases.** Break modernization work along logical boundaries that align with your technical architecture and business priorities. Each phase must deliver a complete, functional improvement that provides measurable value. Define clear completion criteria such as "Phase 1 completes when inventory service runs on Azure Container Apps with 99.9% availability." Plan 2-4 phases initially while maintaining flexibility to adjust based on lessons learned.

    | Division method | Description | Example |
    |-----------------|-------------|---------|
    | By technical component | Separate phases based on workload layers or system boundaries | Phase 1: Database migration, Phase 2: Application refactoring, Phase 3: UI modernization |
    | By risk and complexity | Organize work from low-risk to high-risk changes | Phase 1: Non-critical services, Phase 2: Core business logic, Phase 3: Customer-facing features |
    | By business domain | Structure phases around application or functional boundaries | Phase 1: User management system, Phase 2: Payment processing, Phase 3: Reporting services |

2. **Begin with low-risk modernizations.** Select initial work that provides meaningful improvement without affecting mission-critical systems. Modernize development environments, background services, or read-only databases before production transaction systems. Target completion within 4-6 weeks to build team confidence and validate processes. Early success demonstrates capability and generates stakeholder support for more complex phases.

3. **Sequence remaining phases by value and dependencies.** Prioritize subsequent work based on business impact, technical complexity, and system dependencies. Address high-value, customer-facing features after proving your approach with less critical components. Group interdependent changes within single phases. For example, if database schema changes require application code updates, complete both changes together rather than across separate phases.

4. **Establish measurable success criteria.** Define specific, time-bound targets for each phase such as "Reduce infrastructure costs by 25%" or "Improve API response time to under 200ms." Track both technical metrics (performance, reliability, security) and business outcomes (user experience, operational efficiency) to validate value delivery and guide adjustments.

5. **Validate thoroughly between phases.** Complete comprehensive testing at each phase boundary including functional testing, performance validation, and security scanning. Deploy phase results to production-like environments and monitor system behavior before advancing to the next phase. This approach isolates issues to specific changes and prevents compound problems across multiple phases.

6. **Coordinate parallel work carefully.** Teams can execute compatible work simultaneously, such as infrastructure setup while code refactoring occurs in development branches. Limit parallelization to prevent integration complexity and maintain clear communication protocols between teams. Focus on coordination rather than speed to ensure quality outcomes.

7. **Adapt plans based on results.** Use phase completion results to refine remaining work and timelines. Remove unnecessary tasks, add newly discovered requirements, or adjust phase boundaries based on actual complexity. Maintain the phased approach principles even when modifying plans. Avoid combining multiple phases into single deployments regardless of early phase success.

## Define your deployment strategy

The deployment strategy determines how you move modernized applications from development to production. Your approach affects risk, resource needs, and downtime during modernization.

1. **Apply in-place deployment for simple changes.** Modify existing production systems directly when changes are low-risk and reversible. Use this approach for:

    - Code updates that maintain existing APIs and database structures
    - Configuration changes that complete within 30 minutes
    - Changes with automated rollback scripts or version control reversion
    - Systems with acceptable maintenance windows for brief downtime
    - Updates validated through comprehensive staging environment testing

    This strategy reduces infrastructure costs and accelerates deployment. Consider the trade-off of potential service interruption and limited rollback complexity after deployment.

2. **Use parallel environment deployment for complex changes.** Create a complete modernized environment alongside your current production system. Choose this approach for:

    - Platform migrations from on-premises to cloud infrastructure
    - Architecture changes that modify core system design or data structures
    - Mission-critical systems requiring minimal downtime (under 5 minutes)
    - Data migrations with complex transformations or multi-terabyte datasets
    - Changes requiring coordinated rollback across multiple dependent systems

    Build the modernized environment with all changes, synchronize data between environments, then redirect traffic to the new system while keeping the original system as a fallback option. This approach requires double infrastructure costs during transition but provides maximum safety for critical workloads.

3. **Plan traffic cutover procedures.** Define specific steps to redirect users from the old system to the modernized environment. Document DNS changes, load balancer updates, or database connection string modifications required for the transition. Test cutover procedures in non-production environments to validate timing and identify potential issues. Prepare communication plans to notify users of scheduled changes and expected system behavior during transition periods.

4. **Validate deployment success criteria.** Establish measurable targets to confirm successful deployment such as response times under 500ms, error rates below 0.1%, and all critical user workflows functioning correctly. Monitor these metrics for 24-48 hours after deployment to ensure system stability. Create automated alerts for performance degradation or functional issues that require immediate attention during the post-deployment monitoring period.

## Define rollback and recovery procedures

Even with the best planning and testing, not every change goes perfectly. Modernization often involves complex changes, and there’s always a risk that a deployment could introduce an issue, or something behaves unexpectedly in production. The mark of a well-prepared team is having a solid rollback plan for each change or phase.

1. **Document specific rollback procedures for each deployment type with step-by-step instructions.** For every major change or phase deliverable, write a step-by-step rollback procedure. This should be in your runbook or change plan document. Clearly list each action to undo the change, who is responsible for each step, and how long it would take. After rollback, include what checks confirm things are back to normal.

2. **Automate rollbacks where possible.** Manual rollbacks can be slow and error-prone, especially at 3 AM during an outage. Automated rollback reduces recovery time and eliminates manual errors during high-pressure incident response. Use infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, ARM/Bicep) to re-deploy known good states or blue-green or canary deployments so you can switch back traffic to the source environment. Test rollback automation in staging environments to validate effectiveness and identify potential issues before production deployment. Write the rollback steps alongside the deployment steps, so it’s easy to rollback.

3. **Create a rollback monitoring plan.** If you ever have to perform a rollback, treat it like a deployment and monitor workload health closely. Watch your dashboards (CPU, error rates, response times) to see if metrics are returning to normal ranges. If the rollback involves data, verify data consistency and maybe run queries to ensure records are correct. Have an external observer who is not performing steps but purely watching the effects.

## Secure stakeholder approval

Stakeholder support determines modernization success. Approval requires clear communication about benefits, realistic planning, and ongoing engagement throughout the project lifecycle.

1. **Present clear business value for each audience.** Tailor modernization benefits to specific stakeholder concerns. Technical teams focus on operational improvements: reduced maintenance overhead, improved system reliability, and fewer emergency escalations. Business leaders need financial outcomes: faster product delivery, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced operational expenses. Use concrete examples such as "reduce deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes" or "eliminate weekend maintenance windows" to demonstrate tangible value.

2. **Document a structured plan with measurable deliverables.** Create a high-level roadmap that shows specific workloads, migration phases, and realistic timelines. Include early wins within the first 4-6 weeks to demonstrate progress and validate the approach. Define clear completion criteria for each phase such as "Phase 1 completes when inventory service achieves 99.9% uptime on Azure Container Apps." Use tools like Azure Migrate to assess current workloads and create accurate migration waves. Document resource requirements and dependencies to support accurate planning and budget allocation.

3. **Build a quantified ROI analysis.** Connect modernization investments to specific business outcomes using concrete numbers and timeframes. Present clear financial justification:

    | Category | Example Metrics | Typical Value Range |
    |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
    | Cost Reduction | Infrastructure, maintenance, licensing | 20-40% annual savings |
    | Productivity Gains | Deployment frequency, resolution time | 50-80% improvement |
    | Risk Mitigation | Avoided downtime, security incidents | $100K-$1M+ cost avoidance |
    | Revenue Impact | Faster time-to-market, customer retention | 10-25% revenue acceleration |

4. **Address project risks proactively.** Identify potential challenges and demonstrate preparedness through specific mitigation strategies. Common risks include data migration complexity, performance degradation, and integration issues. Present solutions such as automated rollback procedures, comprehensive testing protocols, and expert consultation availability. Create a one-page project charter that includes a dedicated risk section with clear mitigation plans. Transparent risk discussion builds stakeholder confidence in project leadership and planning thoroughness.

5. **Establish regular communication cadence.** Schedule consistent stakeholder updates through monthly steering committee meetings or weekly status emails to key decision-makers. Report progress against defined success criteria, highlight completed deliverables, and communicate upcoming milestones. Request feedback actively and address concerns promptly to maintain support throughout the modernization process. Use standardized reporting templates to ensure consistent communication quality and stakeholder expectations.
