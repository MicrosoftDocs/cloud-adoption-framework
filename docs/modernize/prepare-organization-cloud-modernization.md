# Prepare your organization for cloud modernization

Cloud modernization is the practice of improving existing workloads in the cloud to better meet business needs and align with cloud best practices. It involves technical enhancements to workloads, services, and infrastructure without adding new end-user features. This framework provides an end-to-end guide for organizations to plan and execute modernization across all their workload teams.

## Define modernization for your organization

1. **Establish a common definition of modernization.** Cloud modernization improves how existing workloads work without building new features. Typical modernization activities include replatforming (moving components to a new hosting environment), refactoring (optimizing or restructuring code), and rearchitecting (redesigning the system’s structure) within the cloud. Modernization excludes net-new features or complete rewrites for new capabilities.

2. **Communicate the definition of modernization.** Share this definition with all relevant teams and stakeholders. Ensure that project managers, engineers, product owners, and executives understand and agree. A unified understanding prevents misalignment.

3. **Create shared responsibility across teams.** Modernization requires collaboration between development, operations, security, and architecture teams. Each team contributes different expertise to modernization success. Establish regular communication and joint decision-making processes. Avoid siloed work that creates integration problems or missed requirements. Assign clear roles while maintaining cross-team coordination.

## Assess modernization readiness and skills

1. **Evaluate your modernization skills.** Before you start, assess what your team knows about cloud services, DevOps practices, and modern workload patterns. Identify the gaps and create a learning plan. Whether that's training your existing team or bringing in outside expertise. Also make sure your CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, and automation tools can support your modernization goals. Skills matter more than technology when it comes to modernization success.

2. **Engage external expertise when needed.** If your team lacks experience with cloud migration, bring in Microsoft or a Microsoft partner. External experts can validate your migration strategy, recommend appropriate tools, and help establish realistic timelines. This support reduces risk and speeds up your migration, especially for complex or large-scale projects.

## Prioritize what workloads to modernize

1. **Assess business value.** Rate each workload by its importance to the business. High-value workloads are those that drive revenue, serve customers, or are critical to operations. Rate technical risk on a consistent scale (say 1–5 or low/med/high). A high score means urgent technical need for improvement. Consider common indicators of high business value:

    | Business value category | Examples |
    |------------------------|----------|
    | Revenue or mission-critical | Systems that process sales transactions or support core business functions (downtime directly means lost money) |
    | Customer experience | Systems that customers or clients directly interact with (performance and reliability affect satisfaction) |
    | Compliance or regulatory | Systems subject to strict regulations or security requirements (failure to update could pose legal risks) |
    | Broad internal dependency | Platforms widely used by employees or other systems (if it's slow or unstable, it drags down productivity across the organization) |

2. **Assess technical risk.** Independently, evaluate the technical state of each system. Essentially, figure out how much it needs modernization. Consider indicators of aging technology or inefficiency:

    | Technical risk category | Examples |
    |------------------------|-----------------|
    | Technical debt | Legacy code with workarounds, outdated frameworks, hard-to-modify architecture |
    | Outdated technology | Operating systems or databases nearing end-of-support, deprecated programming languages |
    | High maintenance effort | Frequent manual interventions, rising support costs, complex troubleshooting processes |
    | Performance and reliability issues | Chronic downtime, slow response times, inability to handle load spikes |
    | Limited scalability | Architecture that requires major rework to grow, manual scaling processes |

3. **Identify urgent modernization triggers.** Specific events or requirements can make modernization urgent, regardless of initial priority rankings. Monitor these triggers to adjust your modernization timeline:

    | Trigger category | Examples |
    |------------------|----------|
    | Security vulnerabilities | Newly discovered security holes in legacy components, outdated encryption protocols, or compliance violations |
    | End-of-support deadlines | Platform or software losing vendor support within 12 months, discontinued security patches |
    | Business growth demands | Rapid customer growth exceeding system capacity, new market entry requirements, or integration needs |
    | System reliability issues | Repeated outages, chronic performance problems, or escalating maintenance costs |

4. **Prioritize workloads.** Combine the business value and technical risk assessments into a simple priority matrix.

    | Business value | Technical risk | Modernization priority | Action |
    |-----------------|----------------|-------------------------|--------|
    | High            | High           | Top priority | Start modernization now. High return on investment |
    | High            | Low            | Monitor | Delay modernization unless specific business benefits exist |
    | Low             | High           | Case-by-case | Don’t modernize immediately unless there’s a clear benefit |
    | Low             | Low            | Do nothing | Modernization effort here would not be a good use of resources. |

## Understand how to modernize

1. **Start with the Azure Well-Architected Framework to identify modernization opportunities.** Think of the Well-Architected Framework as your modernization roadmap. It evaluates your workloads across five key areas: reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency. Run a Well-Architected Review on your workloads to spot gaps. Those gaps become your modernization targets. The bigger the gap, the more urgent the modernization need.

2. **Enable workload teams to make technical modernization decisions.** Teams that maintain workloads daily possess the deepest understanding of technical constraints and user requirements. Workload teams can identify the most effective modernization approaches when they understand business objectives and technical possibilities. Provide teams with clear business context and decision-making authority within established budget and timeline parameters. Establish regular check-ins to ensure alignment with organizational goals while respecting team expertise.
