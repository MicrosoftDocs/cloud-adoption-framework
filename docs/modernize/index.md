**Required to modernization:** Azure modernization skills. Modernization is not just a technical initiative. It’s a strategic necessity.

## Define modernization

Modernization is making improvements to workloads to better meet their requirements and to improve how you operate. Modernization includes moving from virtual machines to platform-as-a-service solutions (replatform).  services. Refactoring code to reduce technical debt. Rearchitecting to adopt cloud-native design.

The goal of modernization isn't to add anything new. The goal is to improve what you have. Modernization should be calculated and intentional to reduce technical debt. Not every workload needs to be modernized. Focus your efforts where modernization delivers clear, measurable value.

## Identify modernization opportunities

Start by identifying which workloads are the best candidates for modernization. Focus on those that will benefit most in terms of reduced operational burden, improved performance, or lower costs.

1. **Commit to modernization.** Modernization is a shared responsibility that requires strong communication and empowerment. Leadership must prioritize modernization and provide resources and support. Set up regular forums for cross-team collaboration and decision-making. Provide templates for cost-benefit analysis. Organizations must clearly articulate the motivations to ensure alignment and commitment across teams.  
    - **Reduce technical debt:** Legacy systems accumulate complexity over time, making them harder and more expensive to maintain.  
    - **Enable growth:** Older architectures often limit scalability, performance, and integration with modern services.  
    - **Avoid end-of-life risks:** Many legacy platforms and open-source tools have limited support lifespans.  
    - **Stay competitive:** Platform-as-a-service solutions enable faster feature delivery, better user experiences, and improved security.

2. **Empower workload teams to modernize.** Teams closest to the applications should be enabled to make informed modernization decisions. Provide them with the tools, training, and resources needed to evaluate modernization opportunities effectively. Workload teams should be trained/upskilled and empowered for self servicing + self management/monitoring by providing them right access to the environment and pipeline for deployment/modifications to their applications

3. **Know when to modernize.** Modernization isn’t routine. It should help you meet your requirements. Assess the cost, risk, and opportunity cost of not modernizing (e.g., delayed features, security gaps) against the benefits of modernization (e.g., reduced risk, lower technical debt, faster time to market for future features).

4. **Know what to modernize.** Use the recommendations in the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework to help identify design issues and potential modernization efforts. The Well-Architected Framework provides workload design best practices. If your workload doesn’t meet its standards, it’s an opportunity to modernize. Examples include:  
    - Addressing scalability issues.  
    - Improving security posture.  
    - Enhancing performance bottlenecks.  
    - Reducing operational overhead through automation or managed services.

5. **Modernize Azure operations.** Infrastructure-as-code and DevOps practices provide standardized, repeatable approaches to infrastructure management. Modern operations enable faster, safer changes and support innovation by allowing teams to quickly create replica test environments. You should adopt infrastructure-as-code to standardize operations and improve deployment consistency. Use Azure Verified Modules. These modules provide pre-tested, standardized infrastructure templates that follow Azure best practices. Azure Verified Modules reduce development time and ensure consistent deployments across environments. Integrate AI-powered development tools. Use GitHub Copilot and Azure Copilot to accelerate code generation and provide intelligent suggestions for infrastructure configurations. These tools help reduce manual coding effort and improve code quality. Establish CI/CD pipelines. Create automated deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to ensure consistent, reliable deployments across all environments.

## Plan the modernization

Once you identify the scope for modernization, the next step is to plan the implementation. This planning phase is essential to ensure your modernization efforts align with cloud design best practices and deliver long-term value. Here’s how:

1. **Treat modernization like a migration.** Modernization often mirrors a migration process and should be approached with similar rigor. Create a modernization roadmap with clear phases, milestones, and rollback plans. Determine when and how workloads will transition to the modernized environment. Prepare Azure environments with governance, security, and networking foundations. Where feasible, modernize components without full re-platforming to reduce risk. 

1. Phased modernization approach - starting with low-risk workloads to validate approach and build confidence. There are instances during ISD engagements where we run into schedule constraints and have to start with a more complex workload to meet time commitments. Not sure we really need to be concerned about this in the documentation if we are wanting to impress best practice, but this is something that frequently comes up during migration/modernization projects.

2. **Choose the right modernization technique.** Workload teams should select the appropriate modernization path based on their specific requirements:
    - **Option 1: Modernize within the existing ecosystem.** Ideal when downtime is acceptable and the current platform can be incrementally improved. Examples include refactoring code, upgrading frameworks, and containerizing apps.
    - **Option 2: Migrate to a new platform.** Suitable when the existing platform is too limiting or costly to maintain. Examples include re-platforming to Azure App Services, moving to Azure Container Apps, or adopting serverless. To choose the right Azure service for each component in your workload, refer to Azure technology decision guides, Azure Database Migration Guides, and Azure Architectures.

3. **Follow design guidance.** Use the Well-Architected Framework and cloud design patterns to guide decisions. Evaluate downtime tolerance, performance needs, and compliance requirements. Ensure code and service changes align with proven best practices. For every new service in your architecture, review its Azure service guides to align each service to best practices.

## Implement modernization changes

Once your plan is in place, begin implementing changes in a controlled, iterative manner. This reduces risk and allows for continuous learning and adjustment.

1. **Make incremental changes.** Avoid a “big bang” rewrite. Instead, modernize in small, manageable stages. Start with one component or service. For example, containerize a single service and deploy it to Azure Container Apps in a development environment. Break work into discrete steps that deliver independent value. For example:
    - Externalize configuration.
    - Implement centralized logging.
    - Containerize the service.
    Each step should improve the system while keeping it stable and testable.

2. **Prevent scope creep.** Modernization should focus on technical improvements, not feature expansion. It’s easy to get sidetracked by adding new functionality, but that can delay delivery and increase risk. Define the scope clearly before starting.  If new features are needed, add them to the Cloud-native backlog.

3. **Test thoroughly.** Modernization can introduce regressions or integration issues. Testing is critical. Use the following testing approaches:
    - Unit tests for any code changes.
    - Integration tests to ensure different services work with the unchanged ones.
    - Performance tests to ensure the new approach doesn’t degrade system performance.

4. **Validate changes.** Use a progressive exposure model like blue-green or canary deployments. With these models, you deploy the modernized updates and test them thoroughly before cutover. The key is to validate in Azure under real conditions and ensure the modernized system can handle production load and patterns. Only flip the switch for all users when you’re confident in the new implementation.

5. **Cut over and deprecate old components.** Plan the transition like a migration cutover. Depending on scope, it might be a series of small cutovers (each component flip) or one larger event (tightly coupled systems). Follow these steps:
    - **Validate dependencies.** Ensure all dependencies now point to the new components or updated code.
    - **Ensure data consistency.** Validate the data flow when switching to a modernized component. For example, if switching databases, migrate data and consider running dual writes for a transition period.
    - **Monitor closely.** Once the modern component is live, monitor it closely. If any issues arise, roll back or fix forward quickly.
    - **Decommission old systems.** After a stable period, shut down old systems. For example, if you moved from VMs to App Service, decommission the VMs and remove any lingering dependencies.

## Optimize post-modernization

Modernization is an ongoing process. Each iteration makes your cloud environment more efficient and easier to maintain. Over time, your applications will use more fully managed services, deployment frequency will increase, and operational incidents will decrease.

1. **Fine-tune configurations.** Azure provides flexibility to quickly adjust resources. Post-modernization, workloads may behave differently. Adjust configurations based on recommendations in their Azure service guides. Use Azure Advisor and Microsoft Defender for Cloud to receive tailored recommendations on cost optimization, performance, reliability, and security.

2. **Monitor costs.** Use Azure Cost Management to identify cost anomalies and Azure Advisor for relevant performance and reliability improvements. Compare current costs to your pre-modernization baseline. Identify and address any configuration or feature changes that increase costs.

3. **Validate monitoring.** Ensure Azure Monitor is capturing the correct metrics and alerts are configured appropriately. Confirm that Azure Monitor is capturing the right metrics and alerts are configured appropriately. AMBA or sign posting it for BAseline alerting, and maybe some literature around Azure Monitor and App Insights. For more information, For more information, see [Monitor your Azure cloud estate](/azure/azure-monitor/overview).

4. **Validate backups.** Confirm backup jobs are configured correctly and completing successfully. Test restore procedures to ensure data recoverability. For more information, see [Manage data reliability](/azure/backup/backup-overview).

5. **Update architecture.** Update your documentation to reflect the modernized system. Capture the current architecture, including all modernized components. update/refine documentation to ensure it aligns with the deployed environment.

6. **Update operations.** Document operational procedures for managing the new environment. Train the operations team on any new technologies, such as container orchestration, serverless functions, or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions.

7. **Gather feedback from users.** Collect and document feedback from end users. Address any issues, such as performance concerns or newly discovered bugs. Positive feedback, such as improved speed, can validate modernization success.

8. **Capture lessons learned.** Document insights from the modernization effort. Identify what worked well and what didn’t. Highlight gaps, such as the need for better development/test environments or more automation. Feed these lessons back into your Cloud Adoption Framework to improve future projects.

9. **Track quantitative outcomes.** Quantify the impact of modernization to demonstrate its value. Track key metrics such as performance improvements, cost savings, and incident reduction. Share results with stakeholders to build support for future modernization efforts. Examples: “Page load time dropped from 4 seconds to 2 seconds.” “We eliminated 3 VMs, saving $X/month.”
