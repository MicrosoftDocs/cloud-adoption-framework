# Optimize workloads after cloud modernization

After you complete a modernization phase or the entire project, it’s time to ensure you’re getting the full benefits and to embed a culture of continuous improvement. The modernized system might have new capabilities (like autoscaling, or new performance tuning toggles), use them. Also, verify that everything is configured correctly for production conditions, and then start looking at what more can be optimized. Think of this stage as closing the feedback loop: measure outcomes, optimize further, and make sure the organization capitalizes on the modernization.

## Optimize configurations for the cloud

Modernizing an app isn't a one-time event. You often can further fine-tune once it’s running in Azure:

1. **Apply Azure Advisor recommendations systematically.** [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) analyzes workload monitoring data and provides actionable recommendations across cost, performance, reliability, and security. Review the recommendations weekly and implement critical changes first. Access Azure Advisor from the Azure portal and filter recommendations by workload or resource group.

2. **Tweak service-specific settings.** Each Azure service has its own configuration settings and best practices. Use the Azure Well-Architected Framework's [Azure services guides](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/?product=popular) to align configurations with best practices.

3. **Address security configuration gaps immediately.** Run Azure security assessment tools now that system is in steady state. [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations) to see if there are any high or medium security recommendations for your resources. Resolve critical and high-severity findings within 48 hours to maintain security posture. Configure continuous assessment to detect new issues as workloads evolve.

## Validate operational readiness

Make sure the operational aspects (monitoring, cost management, backup) are fully in place:

1. **Verify monitoring coverage and accuracy.** Double-check that Azure Monitor is collecting all the logs, metrics, and traces you need. For example, if you introduced new components, ensure you set up logging for those components. Ensure alert rules are firing appropriately. You might do some chaos testing, like remove a service in a test environment, to see if alerts trigger. Update dashboards to reflect the new architecture. Add the new components, and remove old ones. The operations team should have a full view of the system health always.

2. **Establish cost monitoring and controls.** Use [Microsoft Cost Management](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management) to track spending patterns and identify cost optimization opportunities. Set up budget alerts and spending limits to prevent unexpected cost increases. Review the resource utilization weekly and rightsize underutilized components.

3. **Test backup and recovery procedures.**  Ensure your backup solutions are working. If using [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview) or database point-in-time restore, do a test restore of a backup to confirm you can recover data successfully. Document the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) that you achieved. If it doesn’t meet the business need, adjust the backup frequency or method. Make sure all critical data is indeed being backed up (new databases, new storage accounts are included in a backup policy). This check is vital for disaster recovery readiness, which is part of being well-architected.

## Collect user feedback and measure outcomes

One way to gauge success and find further improvement opportunities is through direct feedback and concrete metrics.

1. **Gather structured user feedback regularly.**  After some time running the modernized system, solicit feedback from end users or internal users. Use surveys or feedback forms. Check the support ticket queue. For internal teams, have retrospective meetings. This qualitative data can highlight things monitoring might not.

2. **Track and resolve feedback systematically.** Document all feedback in Azure DevOps or GitHub Issues and categorize by severity and business value. Assign ownership for each issue and establish resolution timelines based on priority. Communicate progress and outcomes to stakeholders monthly.

3. **Measure the actual outcomes versus goals.** Remember those success metrics and return-on-investment projections? Now is the time to see if you achieved them. Compile these results and communicate them to stakeholders. It’s important to close the loop and show the value realized (or identify shortfalls to address). For example, "We achieved a 25% improvement in page load times, leading to a five percent increase in user engagement, and we’re on track to save $250k annually in costs."

## Establish continuous modernization practices

Modernization isn’t a one-time project; it can be an ongoing part of IT strategy. To avoid falling into a new legacy trap, build continuous improvement cycles.

1. **Schedule regular workload reviews.** Every few months, do a [Well-Architected review](/assessments/azure-architecture-review/) or health check for the modernized workloads. Cloud services evolve quickly. Perhaps a new feature could further optimize your system, or usage patterns changed and require tweaks. Document any new gaps or recommendations from these periodic reviews and plan to implement them.

2. **Automate optimization wherever possible.** Use Azure Policy to enforce best practices, like requiring tagging, or blocking insecure configurations, so that drift doesn’t occur over time. Implement autoscaling rules so performance tuning happens on the fly. Set up cost anomaly alerts through Cost Management. By automating, you ensure the system stays optimized without constant human oversight.

3. **Share outcomes and best practices.** Document all successful optimization patterns and share them across teams. Create playbooks for common optimization scenarios and maintain a knowledge base of lessons learned. Contribute optimization insights to organizational cloud adoption practices.
