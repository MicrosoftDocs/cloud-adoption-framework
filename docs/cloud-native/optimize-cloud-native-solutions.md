# Optimize the cloud-native solution after deployment

A deployed solution must evolve to remain secure, cost-effective, and performant. Post-deployment optimization ensures that the workload continues to meet business and technical requirements as usage patterns change.

## Fine-tune service configurations

1. **Apply Azure Advisor recommendations.** [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) analyzes workload monitoring data and provides actionable recommendations across cost, performance, reliability, and security. Review the recommendations weekly and implement critical changes first. Access Azure Advisor from the Azure portal and filter recommendations by workload or resource group.

2. **Implement service-specific optimization settings.** Use the Well-Architected Framework's (WAF) [Azure services guides](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/?product=popular) to align configurations with best practices. This guidance helps ensure workloads are optimized for Azure

3. **Address security findings immediately.** Post-deployment, keep a close eye on security posture. Use tools like [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations) to identify any security misconfigurations, missing updates, or compliance issues. Fix security gaps as soon as they’re discovered to protect the workload and maintain compliance. Security is not a one-and-done task. Continuous monitoring and quick mitigation are key to safe cloud operations.

## Validate operational readiness

Operational readiness determines whether your solution can handle real-world demands and recover from failures. Post-deployment validation confirms that monitoring systems capture the right data, cost controls function properly, and backup procedures work as designed.

### Verify monitoring completeness and accuracy

Ensure that Azure Monitor and any other monitoring tools are tracking all the necessary metrics and logs from your solution. All critical components should be emitting logs and metrics. Test that alerts fire under the expected conditions. For example, trigger a test error or scale condition and see if notifications are sent. Review your dashboards to confirm they reflect the current architecture and provide useful insights at a glance. Effective monitoring is your early warning system for any future issues. For more information, see [Monitor Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor).

### Establish cost monitoring and optimize costs

Now that the solution is live, keep an eye on cloud costs. Use Microsoft Cost Management to review the actual cost incurred by the new solution. Compare it against your estimates and budget. Set up cost alerts or budgets in Azure so that you get notified if spending approaches certain thresholds. Identify any unexpected cost drivers; for example, maybe a service is running 24/7 when it could be turned off during off-hours. Optimizing for cost is an ongoing effort: regularly analyze resource utilization and decommission or downsize anything not fully used. For more information, see [Collect and review cost data](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/collect-review-cost-data), [Set spending guardrails](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/set-spending-guardrails), [Optimize rates](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/get-best-rates), [Align usage to billing increments](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/align-usage-to-billing-increments), [Optimize component costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-component-costs), [Optimize environment costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-environment-costs), [Optimize flow costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-flow-costs), [Optimize data costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-data-costs), [Optimize code costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-code-costs), [Optimize scaling costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-scaling-costs), [Optimize personnel time](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-personnel-time), and [Consolidate resource usage](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/consolidation).

### Test backup and recovery procedures

If your solution includes data stores, ensure Azure Backup or your chosen backup solution is properly backing up all critical data on the schedule you intend. Regularly perform a trial restore (in a nonproduction environment) to verify the data integrity and that the restore process works within your recovery objectives (time and data loss). Document the steps to recover from a major failure, like how to redeploy the infrastructure from code and restore data from backups. Regularly rehearse disaster recovery drills so the team stays practiced in restoring service and you know the documented procedures are up to date and effective. For more information, see [Manage business continuity](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/protect#manage-business-continuity).

## Collect user feedback and measure outcomes

1. **Gather structured user feedback regularly.** Establish channels for users to provide input on the solution’s performance, reliability, and usability. For instance, you could send out a Microsoft Forms survey to end users or internal users after launch and then on a periodic basis. Also pay attention to support tickets or helpdesk calls related to the new solution. Categorize and tally them to spot recurring pain points. Focus on feedback around business-critical workflows. If users find a particular process slow or cumbersome, that’s valuable insight. Regular feedback loops ensure you’re hearing about issues or praise directly from users.

2. **Track and resolve feedback systematically.** Treat feedback items as work items in your development backlog. Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Issues (or your project management tool of choice) to log each piece of feedback or reported issue. Prioritize them by value and urgency. For example, a bug preventing order submissions is critical, whereas a minor UI suggestion is lower priority. Assign owners to investigate and resolve feedback items, and set target dates for resolution. By managing feedback like any other requirement, you ensure it gets triaged and not lost. Close the loop by updating or informing the stakeholders when you act upon the feedback. This process shows users that their input is valued and leads to tangible improvements.

3. **Measure and communicate the business outcomes.**  Now that the solution has been in use, quantify the benefits it delivers. Gather key metrics that align with the original objectives. For example, increased number of transactions per day, reduced page load times, reduced infrastructure cost compared to the old system, improved uptime. Use Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and cost reports to get this data. Compile before-and-after comparisons to illustrate improvements. Then regularly share these results with business stakeholders and the broader team. Demonstrating measurable outcomes not only proves the project’s value but also helps justify future investment in further enhancements.

## Continue to evolve and improve

1. **Schedule periodic workload reviews.** Periodically, revisit the architecture of the solution in light of the [Well-Architected Framework’s](/azure/well-architected/pillars) five pillars. As your usage patterns or business requirements change, certain design decisions might need revisiting. Perform a [Well-Architected Review](/assessments/azure-architecture-review/) to identify any areas for improvement. Document any findings and create action items for things to optimize or refactor in the next cycle. Regular reviews help catch drift from best practices and keep the system aligned with current needs.

2. **Automated optimization where possible.** Look for opportunities to use automation to manage and optimize the solution. For example, use Azure Policy to enforce tagging, security configurations, or resource sizing standards on new deployments so they always remain optimized. Set up autoscaling rules to handle changes in load without manual intervention. Use cost anomaly detection in Microsoft Cost Management to automatically alert if spending spikes unexpectedly. By letting Azure’s automation features handle routine optimizations (like shutting down unused virtual machines on a schedule), your team can focus on higher-level improvements. Automation ensures consistency and can react faster than human intervention for many operational adjustments.

3. **Share lessons and best practices.** Capture what you’ve learned from this cloud-native build and share it with other teams in your organization. For instance, if you developed an effective pattern for blue-green deployments or a useful script for seeding test data, make it available for others. Document the successes and pitfalls encountered during the project as internal case studies. This effort might involve creating a short post-mortem or project retrospective document that highlights what went well and what could be better next time. Contribute updates to your organization’s cloud adoption framework or playbooks so that the next projects can build on your experience. By fostering knowledge sharing, you help improve cloud practices across the organization and drive overall cloud maturity forward.
