# Function of cloud data security

The main objective for a data security team is to provide security protections and detective controls for sensitive enterprise data in any format in any location.

## Modernization

Data security strategies are being shaped primarily by:

- **Data sprawl:** Sensitive data is being generated and stored on a nearly limitless variety of devices and cloud services where people creatively collaborate.
- **New model:** The cloud enables new models of "phone home for key" to supplement and replace classic data loss protection (DLP) models that "catch it on the way out the door"
- **Regulations** like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are requiring organizations to closely track private data and how applications are using it.

## Team composition and key relationships

Data security commonly interacts with following roles in the organization:

- Key business leaders or their representatives
- Records management teams
- Policy and standards teams
- Privacy teams
- IT architecture and operations
- Security architecture and operations
- Legal teams
- Insider risk team
- Compliance/risk management teams

## Next steps
