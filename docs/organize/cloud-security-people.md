# People security functions in the cloud

People security protects the organization from risk of inadvertent human mistakes and malicious insider actions.

## Modernization

Modernization of this function includes:

- **Increase positive engagement** with users using gamification and positive reinforcement / education rather than relying solely on negative reinforcement approaches like traditional "phish and punish" solutions.
- **High quality human engagement:** Security awareness communications and training should be high quality productions that drive empathy and emotional engagement to connect with the human side of employees and the organizations mission.
- **Realistic expectations:** Accept that users will sometimes open phishing emails, and instead focus success metrics on reducing the rate versus expecting to stop 100 percent of opening.
- **Organizational culture change:** Organizational leadership must drive an intentional culture change to make security a priority for each member of the organization.
- **Increased insider risk focus** to help organizations protect valuable trade secrets and other data with highly profitable illicit use cases (such as customer locations or communication records).
- **Improved insider risk detection** which takes advantage of cloud capabilities for activity logging, behavior analytics, and machine learning.

## Team composition and key relationships

People security commonly partners with the following types of roles:

- Audit and legal teams
- Human resources
- Privacy team
- Data security
- Communications teams, for user awareness
- Security operations, for insider risk
- Physical security, for insider risk

## Next steps
