- When the ARM template is used, the following resources are created within Azure.

- **Network Template:** Network Template will create virtual network, Network Security Group, Network Interface, Subnet, Public IP, Load Balancer/App gateway and Redis Cache etc. 
     - Creates a virtual network with string as name, apiVersion, Location and DNS server name.
     - The AddressSpace that contains an array of IP address ranges that can be used by subnets.
   
    - **Virtual network:** An Azure Virtual Network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. When you create a Vnet, your services and VMs within your Vnet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud. More details [Virtual Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).
    - **Network Security Group:** A network security group (NSG) is a networking filter (firewall) containing a list of security rules allowing or denying network traffic to resources connected to Azure Vnets. For more details [network security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).
    -   **Network Interface:** A network interface enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure and on-premises resources. For more details [network interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-netwAork-interface).
    - **Subnet:** A subnet or subnetwork is a smaller network inside a large network. By default, an IP in a subnet can communicate with any other IP inside the Vnet. More details [Subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet). 
    - **Public IP:** Public IP addresses are used to communicate Azure resources to the Internet. The address is dedicated to the Azure resource. More details [Public IP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/public-ip-addresses#:~:text=Public%20IP%20addresses%20enable%20Azure,IP%20assigned%20can%20communicate%20outbound). 
    - **Load Balancer:** It is an efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers in a server farm. Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online. More details [Load balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-load-balancer#:~:text=An%20Azure%20load%20balancer%20is,traffic%20to%20an%20operational%20VM). 
    - ***Note***: Any of the 4 pre-defined template will deploy Azure Load Balancer, only in Fully Configurable deployment user has choice to choose App Gateway instead of Load Balancer.
    -  **Azure Application Gateway**: It is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. More details [App Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview). 
    - **Redis Cache:** Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the open-source software Redis. Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses on backend data stores heavily. It can process large volumes of application request by keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory that can be written to and read from quickly. For more details [redis cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview). 
- **Storage Template:**  
    -  storage account template will create a storage account with File Storage Kind and Premium LRS replication, Size of 1TB. For more details on [storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview). 
    -   As per the predefined template, storage account with Azure files creates File Share.
    -   An Azure storage account contains all your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.
    - The types of storage accounts are General-purpose V2, General-purpose V1, BlockBlobStorage, File Storage, BlobStorage accounts.
    - Types of Replication are Locally redundant storage (LRS), Zone redundant storage (ZRS), Geo redundant storage (GRS).
    - Types of Performance are Standard, Premium.
    - Size(sku):  A single storage account can store up to 500 TB of data and like any other Azure service.
    - Below are types of storage account types ARM template support. 
        - NFS: A Network File System (NFS) allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network and interact with those file systems as though they are mounted locally. This enables system administrators to consolidate resources onto centralized servers on the network. More details on [NFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/nfs/nfs-overview). 
        - GluserFS: It is an open source distributed file system that can scale out in building-block fashion to store multiple petabytes of data. More details on [Gluster FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-rhel-glusterfs). 
        - Azure Files: It is the only public cloud file storage that delivers secure, Server Message Block (SMB) based, fully managed cloud file shares that can also be cached on-premises for performance and compatibility. More details on [Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction). 
            - NFS and glusterFS:  
                - Replication is standard Locally-redundant storage (LRS).  
                - Type is Storage (general purpose v1).
            - Azure Files:  
                - Replication is Premium Locally-redundant storage (LRS).  
                - Type is File Storage.
            - These storage mechanisms will differ according to deployment selected such as:
                - NFS and glusterFS will create a container.  
                - Azure files will create a file share. 
    -  For Minimal and short2mid the template will support nfs and for Large and Maximal the template will support AzureFiles.
    - To access the containers and file share etc. navigate to storage account in resource group in the portal.

- **Database Template:** 
    - This Database template will create an [Azure Database for MySQL server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/mysql/).
    - Azure Database for MySQL is easy to set up, manage and scale. It automates the management and maintenance of your infrastructure and database server, including routine updates, backups and security. Build with the latest community edition of MySQL, including versions 5.6, 5.7 and 8.0.
    - To access the database server created navigate to the resource group provided while deployment and go to Azure Database for MySQL server.  
    - The database server will have a server name, server admin login name, MySQL version, and Performance Configuration. 
    
        
- **Virtual Machine Template:** This template will create a Virtual Machine as Controller Virtual Machine.
    - Controller Virtual Machine: 
        - The OS used at this time is Ubuntu 18.04.
    - VM extension: 
        - Extension can be small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on [Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview).
        - VM extension will executes a shell script file which installs Moodle on the Controller Virtual Machine and captures the log files. 
        - Log files stderr and stdout are created at the /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/  
        - User can view the log files as a root user. 
- **Scale Set Template**: 
    -   This template will create a [Virtual Machine Scale set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). 
    - A virtual machine scale set allows you to deploy and manage a set of auto-scaling virtual machines. You can scale the number of VMs in the scale set manually or define rules to auto scale based on resource usage like CPU, memory demand, or network traffic.
    - Autoscaling of VM Instances depends on [CPU utilization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/autoscale-overview).  
    - While scaling up an instance a VM is deployed and a shell script is executed to install the Moodle prerequisites and setting up cron jobs. 
    - VM instances have Private IP. 
    - For connecting to VMs on Scale set with private IP, follow the steps written in the [document](/vpngateway.md).
