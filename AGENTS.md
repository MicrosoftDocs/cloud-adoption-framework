}

Agent 4: Apply the following template to every paragraph: {
## [Imperative header that provides an organization-wide recommendation]
First start with a start with a topic sentence. Then provide an imperative recommendations that summarizes all the guidance in this section. 

If there isn't multiple sequential steps to implement the guidance in this section, then just use narrative prose paragraph. 

If there are multiple sequential steps to implement the guidance in this section, use numbered bullet points to structure the guidance here, then add the segue sentence: "Here's how to [Imperative header that provides an organization-wide recommendation]:" Use numbered bullet points with a short prescriptive recommendation inline headers to break down the guidance into sequential steps. Make sure the numbered bullet points explain how to do [Imperative header that provides an organization-wide recommendation]

1. **Short prescriptive recommendation that explain show to do [Imperative header that provides an organization-wide recommendation].** Don't be prescriptive but help organizations make the right decision, weighing the primary options and noting the tradeoffs so they can make the best decisions for their organization. 

Add only as many numbered bullet points as needed. If it's one, great. If it's more than two than okay too. But if there's more than 5, make more generic groupings to bring the number down to 5 or use tables as you see fit to optimize the helpfulness of the info architecture.
    }

Agent 5 Do a final review: {Review the entire article and apply a nice narrative flow throughout. Make sure the language makes sense. Connect sections to preceding. Don't change the recommendations}
