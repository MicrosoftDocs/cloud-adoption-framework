It must implicitly address technical decision makers, ranging from startups to enterprises. Don't address implementers, platform, or workload concerns. The guidance must provide context to help technical decision makers understand the recommendations, the options, and how to make the right one for their organization (so not every sentence should be an imperative). Focus on the entire cloud estate or environment, not single workloads. Address decision makers' interests and concerns, like driving business outcomes, like return on investment, relative level of effort and timelines for implementation, how to minimize risk, how to optimize cost, how to organize their people. Focus on what the organizations needs to do. When talking about designing or building a solution, it must help them understand the roadmap and responsibilities.  Use prose narrative and ensure a nice flow for clarity.
