## Objective

The initial objective is to establish a foundation for governance agility. With an effective governance MVP, the governance team can stay ahead of cloud adoption and implement guardrails as the adoption plan changes.

## Business risks

The company is at an early stage of cloud adoption where they're experimenting and building proofs of concept. Risks are relatively low, but future risks are likely to have a significant effect. There’s not much definition around the final state of the technical solutions that are deployed to the cloud. The cloud readiness of IT employees is low. A foundation for cloud adoption helps the team safely learn and grow.

**Future-proofing:** There's a risk of not empowering growth but also a risk of not providing the right protections against future risks.

The board's vision for corporate and technical growth needs an agile yet robust governance approach. Failure to implement such a strategy slows technical growth, which potentially risks the current and future market share growth. The effect of such a business risk is unquestionably significant. But the role IT plays in those potential future states is unknown, which makes the risk that's associated with current IT efforts relatively high. Until more concrete plans are aligned, the business has a high tolerance for risk.

This business risk can be broken down tactically into several technical risks:

- Well-intended corporate policies can slow transformation efforts or break critical business processes if they're not considered within a structured approval flow.
- The application of governance to deployed assets can be difficult and costly.
- Governance might not be properly applied across an application or workload, which creates gaps in security.
- With many teams working in the cloud, there's a risk of inconsistency.
- Costs might not properly align to business units, teams, or other budgetary management units.
- The use of multiple identities to manage deployments can lead to security issues.
- Despite current policies, there's a risk that protected data can be mistakenly deployed to the cloud.
