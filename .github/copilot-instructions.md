The Cloud Adoption Framework helps customers of all sizes to adopt Azure, succeed in Azure, and mature in Azure. 
The Cloud Adoption Framework helps customers make the right decisions faster, noting tradeoffs and helping them weigh pros and cons of different options. 

Execute each of the following steps in order, ensuring that each step is completed before moving to the next.

    Review all the content to ensure it aligns with the following template

        Template:{
        ---
        title: Descriptive title that clearly states the customer outcome
        description: Brief description explaining what the customer will achieve after following this guidance
        author: github-username
        ms.author: microsoft-alias
        ms.date: current date MM/DD/YYYY
        ms.topic: conceptual
        ---

        # The {titleheader} must be the same as the title in the metadata

        "This article explains how to" specific customer outcome. Descriptively state why this guidance is important without stating "is it important/crucial/critical because" (1-2 sentences)

        ## Each heading must be an imperative recommendation.

        Every heading must have an introduction. This first sentence defines important words in {heading-n} in the context of {titleheader}. Don't start this sentence with a gerund (1 sentence). The next sentence must descriptive states why this {heading-n} is important in the context of {titleheader} (1 sentence). The next sentence states what you must do to reach to the ideal end state implied in heading-n. It needs to provide an overview of all the following bullet points without enumerating all of them (1 sentence)]. Follow these steps:

        1. **Start every {bulletpoint-n} with be an bold imperative recommendation, and ensure it's logically the n-th step compared to the other recommendations.** Then explain why this {bulletpoint-n} recommendation is important in the context of this {heading-n}. Don't say "is critical" or "is important", just be descriptive about why this recommendation is important in this context (1 sentence). Next outline how to implement this recommendation. If available, indicate how Azure or other tools, services, features facilitate the implementation of this {bulletpoint-n} recommendation; use links to product docs to describe these tools, services, and features (1-3 sentences).].

        1. Repeat the previous pattern as many times as needed

        ## Add as many headings and sub headings as needed. But enforce this style and format throughout.

        ## Review the content and create a table of relevant tools in a table as follows

        | Category | Tool | Description |
        |----------|------|-------------|
        | [Tool category 1] | [Tool name with link] | [Brief description of how it supports the recommendations] |
        | [Tool category 2] | [Tool name with link] | [Brief description of implementation support] |

        ## Next steps
