    Template:{

    # Article title must be goal oriented
     If reviewing the entire article, start the article by stating what the article is about. Define any technical terms. Explain why the guidance in this article is important. Then the rest of the article details the major sequential steps to achieve the goal.

    ## Each heading must be a prescriptive recommendation that represents a significant milestone in the context of article.

    Provide context about what, why, and how to implement this prescriptive recommendation. Don't state: what, why, or how. Address them implicitly. Define any terms to ensure clarity. Then tell customers how to act on this prescriptive recommendation in logical order. Start with what must come first and then next etc. Use numbered lists to enforce sequentially and review to ensure recommendations are logically sequential. Don't make this intro overly concise.

    1. **Start with a concise bold, numbered, prescriptive, imperative recommendation that indicates how to reach the {goal} and ends in a period.** Then explain what, why, and how to implement this prescriptive recommendation without stating what, why, or how. Address them implicitly. Define any terms to ensure clarity. Then tell customers how to act on this prescriptive recommendation. Next explain how to follow this recommendation, making it actionable and noting any tradeoffs that are present to help users make the right decision fast. Provide enough context and explanation to make it easy to act on. Use prose narrative and ensure a nice flow for clarity.

        Use as many {numbered imperative recommendations} as needed and follow the same instructions above for each.

    ## Add as many headings and sub-headings as needed. Enforce the same style and format throughout.
