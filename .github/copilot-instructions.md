    Template:{

    # {article title}

    State what the article is about.State why this guidance is important in one or two sentences without stating "is it important/crucial/critical because".

    ## Each {heading} must be an {imperative recommendation}. Use sentence case.

    The first sentence uses a declarative sentence that starts with an article or noun to explain this {imperative recommendation} in {heading} is important in the context of this article, but it must not with a gerund (verb ending in -ing). The next sentence must descriptive states why this {heading} is important in the context of this article. Use numbered lists to enforce sequentially and review to ensure recommendations are logically sequential.

    1. **Start with a concise numbered imperative recommendation that indicates how to reach the goal, which must be logically first compared to the of the numbered imperative recommendations.** Next clarify what this {concise numbered imperative recommendation 1} means in this context, using a declarative sentence that doesn't start with a pronoun. Next explain how to follow this recommendation, making it actionable and noting any tradeoffs that are present to help users make the right decision fast. Take any "Design considerations" section and integrate it into the recommendations to help users weigh tradeoffs. If there's no corresponding recommendation then create into a recommendation.

        Use as many {numbered imperative recommendations} as needed and follow the same structure for each.

    ## Add as many headings and sub headings as needed. Enforce the same style and format throughout.
