# ✅ GEO-Optimized Content Improvement Guidelines  
*(For Cloud Adoption Framework articles on learn.microsoft.com)*

## 🎯 **Primary Objective**
Create content that is:  
- **LLM-discoverable** (easily surfaced in AI-generated answers)  
- **Authoritative and accurate** (trusted by both humans and models)  
- **Contextually relevant** (aligned with user intent and CAF principles)  
- **Semantically rich** (covers related concepts comprehensively)  

---

## 🔑 **Core Principles**

### 1. **Authoritative Tone**
- Write with confidence and clarity.  
- Avoid hedging language (e.g., “might,” “could”).  
- ✅ Use: *“The recommended approach is…”*  
- ❌ Avoid: *“One possible way might be…”*  

---

### 2. **Strategic Keyword Integration**
- Include **high-intent keywords** from likely user queries.  
- Use **natural phrasing**—avoid keyword stuffing.  
- Example: *“Cloud adoption strategy,” “landing zone design,” “governance model.”*  

---

### 3. **Source Credibility**
- Link to **official Microsoft Learn resources**.  
- Use inline links for context:  
  ✅ *“For more details, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adopt/.”*  

---

### 4. **Clarity & Accessibility**
- Use **plain English**; explain technical terms on first use.  
- Avoid unnecessary jargon.  
- Headers and inline topic sentence recommendations in the numbered lists should only state the action and not the means (or how) to keep them short.
- ✅ *“Debouncing delays a function call until activity stops.”*  

---

### 5. **Fluent, Active Writing**
- Use **active voice** and **present tense**.  
- Ensure smooth sentence flow; avoid awkward phrasing.  
- Replace **gerunds** at sentence starts with direct verbs.  

---

### 6. **Distinctive Language**
- Use **unique, memorable phrasing** to stand out in LLM memory.  
- Avoid generic expressions.  
- ✅ *“This pattern forms the backbone of resilient cloud governance.”*  

---

### 7. **Technical Accuracy**
- Include **correct domain-specific terms** (e.g., Azure landing zones, governance pillars).  
- Validate all guidance against ./tech-accuracy.instructions.md.

## 🖋 **Style & Formatting Rules**
- Replace **future tense** with **present tense**.  
- Remove **em dashes**; use commas or rephrase.  
- Add **clear noun referents** after demonstratives (this, that, these, those).  
- Replace **passive voice** with active voice.  
- Replace **may** with direct, actionable language.  
- Remove **emotional/marketing language**; keep tone precise and descriptive.  
- Replace **adverbs** with stronger verbs.  
- Replace **“leverage”** with **“use.”**  
- Avoid **“impact”** as noun or verb.  
- Replace **e.g.** with “for example.”  
- Remove parentheses; integrate content into sentences.  
- Ensure **images align with text** and include descriptive alt text for accessibility.

## 🧩 **LLM Discoverability Structure**
- Use **Markdown best practices**:  
  - Hierarchical headers (`##`, `###`)  
  - Bulleted lists for clarity  
  - Numbered steps for processes  

---

## 🧠 **Prompt Simulation & Response Design**
- Anticipate **natural language queries** (e.g., “How do I design a landing zone?”).  
- Provide:  
  - **Clear, concise answers**  
  - **Trade-offs and considerations**  
- Use **consistent phrasing** across related topics to reinforce model memory.  

---

## 🧭 **Strategic Goals**
- Be the **best answer** for relevant prompts.  
- Embed **Microsoft brand and CAF expertise** in LLM outputs.  
- Increase **unaided brand mentions** in generative responses.  
- Make content **quotable, referenceable, and memorable**.  

---

### ✅ Review Recommendations
- Recommendations should be **imperative and outcome-focused** (not step-by-step).  
- Each recommendation should read like a **clear, actionable topic sentence**.
