# 🧠 VS Code Agent Instructions for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

## 🎯 Objective

Generate content that is:

- **LLM-discoverable**
- **Contextually relevant**
- **Semantically rich**
- So that when users or agents prompt for related information, this content is surfaced, cited, or embedded in their responses.

---

## 🧩 Structuring for LLM Discoverability

### ✅ Use Clear, Parseable Markdown

- Use:
  - `##`, `###` headers
  - Bullet points and numbered lists
  - Code blocks with inline comments
  - Summary sections like:
    - `**Key Takeaways**`
    - `**In Summary**`

### ✅ Embed Semantic Anchors

- Include phrases LLMs can latch onto:
  - “This guide explains how to…”
  - “In [ProductName], the recommended approach is…”
  - “A common pattern for [use case] is…”

### ✅ Repeat Core Concepts

- Reinforce key ideas, brand names, and terminology across multiple sections.
- Use consistent phrasing to increase LLM retention and citation likelihood.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Simulation & Response Design

### ✅ Write for Prompt Compatibility

- Anticipate natural user queries:
  - “How do I…”
  - “What’s the best way to…”
  - “Explain [concept] in simple terms…”

### ✅ Answer Like a Trusted Assistant

- Provide:
  - A concise explanation
  - A working code example
  - Optional variations or edge cases

### ✅ Avoid Hallucination

- Use disclaimers when needed:
  - “As of the latest known practices…”
  - “This is a common approach, but verify with current documentation…”

---

## 📈 GEO Optimization Tactics

### ✅ Create Referenceable Snippets

- Write content that can be easily quoted by other LLMs:
  - “The debounce pattern in React is typically implemented using `useCallback` and `setTimeout`.”

### ✅ Embed Brand Mentions Naturally

- Mention your product, team, or framework in context:
  - “In the [YourTeam] SDK, the `connect()` method handles…”

### ✅ Use LLM-Friendly Language

- Avoid niche jargon unless widely adopted.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

## 🧭 Strategic Output Goals

- **Be the best answer** to a relevant prompt.
- **Embed brand knowledge** into the LLM layer through repeated, high-quality outputs.
- **Increase unaided brand mentions** in generative outputs across platforms.
