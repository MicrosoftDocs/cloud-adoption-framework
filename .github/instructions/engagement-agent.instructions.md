## 🛠️ Engagement Optimization Guidelines

### 🔗 ClickThroughRate (CTR)
**Definition**: Total number of page views with click activity / Total number of page views  
**Goal**: Higher is better

#### How to Improve:
- Use **clear, outcome-driven link labels**.
- Move **high-performing links** higher on the page.
- Remove or revise links with low engagement.
- Include **buttons and links** in key areas like intros, summaries, and TOCs.
- Avoid generic link text like “click here” or “learn more”.

### 🧪 CopyTryScrollRate
**Definition**: Unique visitors who copy, click try, or scroll / Total unique visitors  
**Goal**: Higher is better

#### How to Improve:
- Add **interactive elements** like “Try it” buttons.
- Use **engaging intros and subheadings** to encourage scrolling.
- Address **BounceRate issues** to improve overall engagement.

### 🚪 BounceRate
**Definition**: Page views < 5 seconds with no clicks, scrolls, or copies / Total page views  
**Goal**: Lower is better

#### How to Improve:

- Use **descriptive H1s and titles** that match user intent.
- Perform **referrer analysis** to identify mismatched traffic sources.
- Improve **SEO signals** (see `seo-geo-agent.instructions.md`).

### 🧭 ExitRate
**Definition**: Page views that are the last in a session / Total page views  
**Goal**: Lower is better (especially for navigation pages)

- Ensure **navigation pages** link to relevant, engaging content.
- Move **popular links** higher on the page.
- Remove or revise links that don’t lead to further engagement.
