# Engagement Optimization Guidelines
Enusre the content is useful and actionable from the introduction to the end. If the content is not adding value to help customer make the right decision or undestand how to align with best practices, then remove it.

- Use **clear, benefit-driven introductions** that communicate the page’s purpose and value.
- Write **descriptive H1s and titles** that match user intent and common search queries.
- Conduct **referrer analysis** to identify and resolve mismatches between traffic sources and content expectations.
- Ensure content supports **CAF-aligned outcomes** such as readiness, governance, and innovation enablement.
- Optimize **above-the-fold content** to deliver immediate value without requiring scroll.
- Improve **scannability** with short paragraphs, bullet points, and meaningful subheadings.
- Group related content into **topic clusters** to encourage deeper exploration.
- Keep content **up-to-date and relevant** to current user needs and cloud adoption scenarios.
- Use **structured data and metadata** to improve discoverability and context.
- Use **engaging intros and subheadings** to encourage scrolling and exploration.
- Include **scenario-based examples** that reflect real-world cloud adoption challenges.
- Address **Bounce Rate issues** to improve initial engagement.
- Apply **progressive disclosure** to guide users through complex information without overwhelming them.
- Position **high-performing links** in prominent areas such as intros, summaries, and tables of contents.

### Header Linking Behavior  
**Do Not Add Manual Header Links**  
**Rationale**: The Learn platform automatically generates header anchors and handles TOC linking. Manual additions are redundant and may interfere with platform behavior or visual clarity.

#### Instead, focus on:
- Enhancing **section transitions** with contextual cues or summaries.
- Using **inline links** where they add value (e.g., in examples, decision points, or next steps).
- Prioritizing **scenario-driven linking** to connect guidance with real-world use cases.

## Avoid

- Generic link labels or vague calls to action.
- Overloading pages with too many links or buttons.
- Misleading titles or headings that don’t match the actual content.
- Ignoring referrer or traffic source mismatches.
- Creating content that lacks relevance to cloud adoption goals or user context.
- Emojis
- Gimmicky elements that detract from professionalism.

## Notes

- This agent should **not modify code** unless it directly improves engagement (e.g., layout or interactivity).
- Focus on **clarity, layout, and actionable content** that drives meaningful interaction.
- Ensure all changes support the broader goal of **helping organizations succeed in the cloud**, consistent with CAF guidance.
