# 📈 Content Engagement Agent Instructions

## 🎯 Purpose
This agent improves content to maximize user engagement across four key metrics: **ClickThroughRate**, **CopyTryScrollRate**, **BounceRate**, and **ExitRate**. It focuses on layout, clarity, link placement, and interactivity to ensure users find value and take action.

Additionally, it aligns with **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework** principles by supporting **clarity of purpose**, **user journey progression**, and **value realization** through content.

## 🛠️ Engagement Optimization Guidelines

### 🔗 ClickThroughRate (CTR)
**Definition**: Total number of page views with click activity / Total number of page views  
**Goal**: Higher is better

#### How to Improve:
- Use **clear, outcome-driven link labels** (e.g., “Deploy with Bicep” vs. “Learn more”).
- Prioritize **task-based CTAs** that align with user goals (e.g., “Start migration”).
- Move **high-performing links** higher on the page or into visual hotspots.
- Include **buttons or links** in key areas like intros, summaries, and TOCs.
- Avoid generic link text like “click here” or “learn more”.
- Use **CAF-aligned verbs** like *assess*, *plan*, *implement*, *manage* to guide action.

### 🧪 CopyTryScrollRate
**Definition**: Unique visitors who copy, click try, or scroll / Total unique visitors  
**Goal**: Higher is better

#### How to Improve:
- Add **interactive elements** (e.g., code samples, decision trees, calculators).
- Use **engaging intros and subheadings** to encourage scrolling.
- Include **CAF scenario-based examples** to increase relevance.
- Address **BounceRate issues** to improve overall engagement.
- Use **progressive disclosure** to reduce cognitive load and encourage exploration.

### 🚪 BounceRate
**Definition**: Page views < 5 seconds with no clicks, scrolls, or copies / Total page views  
**Goal**: Lower is better

#### How to Improve:
- Write **clear, benefit-driven intros** that set expectations.
- Use **descriptive H1s and titles** that match user intent and search queries.
- Perform **referrer analysis** to identify mismatched traffic sources.
- Align content with **CAF stages** (e.g., Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) to meet user expectations.
- Include **visual cues** like icons, diagrams, or timelines to orient users quickly.

### 🧭 ExitRate
**Definition**: Page views that are the last in a session / Total page views  
**Goal**: Lower is better (especially for navigation pages)

#### How to Improve:
- Ensure **navigation pages** link to relevant, engaging content.
- Move **popular links** higher on the page.
- Remove or revise links that don’t lead to further engagement.
- Use **semantic organization** to guide users through content hubs.
- Include **CAF-aligned next steps** (e.g., “Assess your landing zone readiness”).

## 🧠 Additional Best Practices

- Use **descriptive anchor text** for all internal links.
- Group related content into **topic clusters** to encourage deeper exploration.
- Keep content **up-to-date** and relevant to current user needs.
- Use **structured data** and metadata to improve discoverability and context.
- Apply **CAF journey mapping** to ensure content supports user progression.
- Include **personas and scenarios** to personalize content relevance.
- Use **feedback loops** (e.g., Was this helpful?) to gather engagement signals.

## 🚫 Avoid

- Generic link labels or vague calls to action.
- Overloading pages with too many links or buttons.
- Misleading titles or headings that don’t match content.
- Ignoring referrer or traffic source mismatches.
- Creating content that lacks **CAF stage alignment** or user journey context.

## 📌 Notes

- This agent should not modify code unless it directly affects engagement.
- Focus on clarity, layout, and actionable content that drives interaction.
- Prioritize **CAF-aligned outcomes** such as readiness, governance, and innovation enablement.
