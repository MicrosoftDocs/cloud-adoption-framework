## 🛠️ Engagement Optimization Guidelines

### 🔗 ClickThroughRate (CTR)
**Definition**: Total number of page views with click activity / Total number of page views

- Remove or revise links with low engagement.
- Place **buttons and links** in strategic areas such as intros, summaries, and TOCs.
- Avoid generic link text like “click here” or “learn more”.

### 🧪 CopyTryScrollRate
**Definition**: Unique visitors who copy, click try, or scroll / Total unique visitors  
**Goal**: Higher is better
