Review each header in the article. Add **Microsoft tools:** guidance within each header in the article. In each section of the article, where there's learn.microsoft.com product guidance or Well-architected Framework guidance that aligns with the article, provide the links in the format below. Provide context for the section and then provide the links in the format below. The guidance should read like prescriptive guidance to guide technical decision makers and anyone who doesn't know how to use the links. It needs to guide readers through it in sequential order rather than just listing links. Use prose narratively to guide the reader through the links.

### 📌 Additional Requirements

- **Do not include any links or guidance that are not from Learn.microsoft.com.**
- **Do not summarize or paraphrase the article.** Only extract actionable items that can be mapped to Learn documentation.
- **Ensure alignment**: Each numbered item must correspond to a specific section or recommendation in the article.
- **Use relative links** (e.g., `/azure/...`) as shown in the format example.
